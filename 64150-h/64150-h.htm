<p class="cap">“Oh, see the pretty little boy! Is the
pretty little boy going to play football?
The pretty little boy is going to
play football—<em>per-haps</em>!”</p>

<p>The speaker, one of four youths seated on the
grass near the side line, chuckled as the subject
of his humor turned inquiringly.</p>

<p>“What will happen to the pretty little boy
and his nice clean trousers and his beautiful
red jersey?” continued another of the quartette,
adopting the first speaker’s sing-song
style. “Oh, please, teacher, I’d rather not say!
It will be a perfect shame, will it not?”</p>

<p>“<em>It will not!</em>” responded a third youth
promptly and emphatically. The boys laughed
enjoyably, unaffected by the fact that the
“pretty little boy” was viewing them doubtfully,
uncomfortably from the distance of a
dozen yards away.</p>

<p>It was hardly fair to call him pretty, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
his fresh complexion, yellow-brown hair and
rather finely cut features made him strikingly
good-looking. He was fairly tall for his age,
which was fifteen, well made and carried himself
with a lithe grace emphasized by the new
suit of football togs he wore. The khaki trousers
were quite immaculate, and so were the red
stockings, and so was the red jersey. Even
his shoes were unscuffed, and altogether he
looked very much as though he had but a moment
before stepped from the pictured advertisement
of some dealer in athletic supplies.
Possibly it was the fashion-plate suggestion
that had prompted the group near by to ridicule.</p>

<p>At first Harry Danforth had not associated
the remarks with himself and had looked
around out of sheer curiosity. When he understood
that he was the butt of their humor the
blood flooded into his cheeks and he faced hurriedly
away. Like many boys with fair complexions,
he blushed on slight provocation, and
he was always ashamed of it. He walked slowly
away in an effort to evade his tormentors, but
their voices still reached him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, see the blush of modesty upon the face
of the pretty little boy! How beautiful is modesty!”</p>

<p>There was more, but Harry didn’t hear it.
Taking refuge at the edge of a group of waiting
candidates, he sought to forget his burning
cheeks. But as, at his advent, many of the fellows
turned to observe him, his embarrassment
continued.</p>

<p>“See the study in red,” whispered one youth
laughingly to his companion, and although he
had not meant the strange boy to hear him, the
latter did hear, and felt the blood surging
harder than before into his face. He was heartily
glad when, at that instant, the coach summoned
them on to the field.</p>

<p>There were fully sixty candidates on hand
that first afternoon of football practice at Barnstead
Academy. Some few of them were members
of the last season’s eleven, more were second-string
players of the year before, and the
balance were, like Harry, new candidates. Mr.
Worden, the head coach, a finely built, pleasant-faced
man of about thirty, took the names of all
who had reported. In this task he was assisted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
by a boy of eighteen or so whose name Harry
later learned was Phillips. Phillips was manager
of the team. Harry gave his name, age,
class, weight and details of former football
experience to Phillips and was promptly sent
to the awkward squad, or Squad Z, as the school
facetiously termed it. There he was one of a
group of some twenty youths whose ages
ranged from thirteen to sixteen and who, in the
course of the hour’s instruction that followed,
exhibited every phase of football inexperience.
The awkward squad was in charge of a large
boy whom the coach addressed as Barrett. Barrett
looked to be about seventeen and wore a
vastly bored expression all the time that he labored
with the beginners. If his features
lighted at all during that period it was when
Harry showed by his handling of the pigskin
that he at least might possibly have the makings
of a player. Barrett watched him speculatively,
almost interestedly, at intervals, and
once even vouchsafed a grunt of satisfaction
as Harry fell neatly on a wabbling ball and
snuggled it under his chest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the more advanced candidates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
were punting and catching or trotting about
the field behind a shrill-voiced quarterback.
Harry, in the intervals between his own duties,
had time to watch, and what he saw he found a
little bit discouraging. Where he had come
from, quite a ways beyond the New England
hills that closed this pleasant valley at the west,
he had been looked on as something of a player.
On his high school team he had made a reputation
for himself that was quite remarkable considering
his age, and when, in the Spring, he
had announced his impending departure for
preparatory school his schoolmates had set up
a veritable howl of despair. Once reconciled,
however, they had pictured in gorgeous colors
Harry’s football future. Of course he would
make the school team at Barnstead at once,
would do wonderful things there and then go
up to college far-famed and glorious. Pete Wilkinson,
avid reader of romance, had drawn
Harry aside and begged him not to accept the
first offer he received from college scouts.</p>

<p>“Just hold back on them and they’ll give you
anything you want, Harry. Wait till you get
all the offers and then choose the best. Why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
the big colleges will do most anything for fellows
who can play the game the way you can!”</p>

<p>Harry had gravely promised to be discreet
in the matter, not considering it worth while to
point out to the sanguine Pete that even if the
colleges clamored and fought for him, which he
didn’t in the least consider likely, he had already
made up his mind where to go and that
all the bribes in the world would not change his
mind. But while he was a person of some note
at Hillston High School, he felt himself a very
small and unimportant atom here at Barnstead.
He had come quite unheralded and his fame
had not preceded him. Here he was just one
more kid to be hammered into shape or, found
wanting, to be tossed aside with the other discards
in the yearly game of making a football
team. And watching the play of the experienced
fellows, Harry saw that there was quite
a difference between Hillston standards and
Barnstead! The team here was evidently made
up of fellows much older than he, for one thing.
His roommate, a chap named Colgan, whose
athletic interests stopped at an occasional set
of tennis, had told him that Coach Worden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
showed a partiality for the younger candidates
and that Harry’s youthfulness would not be a
disadvantage if he could play the game. But
this afternoon, with so many older fellows in
sight, Harry felt that if he made the school
team inside the next two years he would be
lucky. But in spite of discouraging thoughts
he paid flattering attention to Barrett’s instructions,
performed as well as he knew how and
proved a shining example to the other members
of Squad Z.</p>

<p>After an hour of rather wearisome instruction
in the a, b, c’s of the game the awkward
squad was dismissed. Harry imagined he could
hear Barrett’s sigh of relief! Donning his
sweater, Harry trotted in the wake of the
others across the end of the field, through the
gate and up the hill to the gymnasium. As he
knew none of his companions, and as the work
had left them too tired to want to be sociable,
he spoke to no one until, having had his shower
and dressed himself, he was walking across the
campus toward his room in Temple Hall. And
even then the conversation was none of his
choosing!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>“Why, if it isn’t our friend the football
hero!” exclaimed a voice. Harry was passing a
group of half a dozen boys on the main path
across the campus. Resisting the impulse to
turn, he kept on his way until a second youth
called to him.</p>

<p>“Hi, kid! Why so haughty?”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon?” Harry paused and faced
them then. They were all rather older than he,
one, a dark-complexioned fellow of seventeen or
eighteen, evidently being the leader of the
party.</p>

<p>“Don’t apologize,” he begged. “You don’t
mind our speaking to you, do you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Harry quietly, feeling the
blood creeping into his cheeks and hating himself
for it. “What did you want, please?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—suspecting that you were a
stranger to our—to these classic shades we
wouldst make thee welcome,” replied the dark
chap with a grin. “Wouldst impart to us thy
cognomen?”</p>

<p>“My name’s Danforth,” answered Harry
shortly, facing the smiling faces about him with
a frown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“’Tis a fair name, my boy. Why blush for
it?”</p>

<p>“I’m not.”</p>

<p>“You’re not!” gibed another boy. “What do
you call it? Say, kid, you’re as red as a beet.
What are you ashamed of?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Is that all you want?”</p>

<p>“Leave us not in anger,” begged the first
speaker. “Tell us, rather, of your doughty
deeds upon yon trampled field of battle. Didst
lay about thee mightily? Didst slay the first
team with thine own good right hand?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Harry, biting his lip to keep
down the anger that was beginning to boil inside
him.</p>

<p>“No? And what didst thou do, O Ensanguined
Knight?”</p>

<p>“I minded my own business, for one thing,”
answered the other shortly, turning to go on.</p>

<p>But some one seized his arm and spun him
around again.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked the dark-complexioned
youth threateningly. “Say, you’re a sort of a
fresh kid, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Not when I’m left alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>“Well, suppose I don’t choose to let you
alone?” The bully stepped close to Harry and
stuck his face down with an ugly leer on it.
“What would you do then, Fresh?”</p>

<p>“Let him be, Perry,” said one of the group.
“He’s only a kid.”</p>

<p>“He’s a pretty fresh kid, though,” replied
Perry. “You are, aren’t you?” He laid a
hand on Harry’s shoulder and gripped it
hard.</p>

<p>“If you don’t like my—my ways, let me
alone,” answered Harry between set teeth.</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll let you alone!” Perry thrust his
right foot forward, and with a sudden push
sent the other stumbling backward. When
Harry brought up he was seated under a bush
at the side of the path and Perry and several
of the others were laughing heartily. But one
of the group had sprung forward, and now he
was helping Harry to his feet.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind him, kid,” he said in a low voice.
“Run along now. No harm done.” He brushed
some leaves from the boy’s back and gave him
a good-natured shove in the direction of the
dormitory. But Harry, his face white now and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
his body trembling, strode across to the group
and faced the chief tormentor.</p>

<p>“You’re a big bully, that’s what you are!”
he declared hotly. “Leave your crowd and
come over here with me! I dare you to!”</p>

<p>Perry growled something and lifted his hand,
but the others intervened.</p>

<p>“Cut it, Perry! Let the kid alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; no scrapping, Perry. He’s
too small for you.”</p>

<p>“I—I’ll punch his pretty little face for
him!” snarled Perry, striving to push by his
friends.</p>

<p>“You touch me and I’ll show you something
you won’t like,” said Harry, standing his
ground.</p>

<p>“You shut up, kid, and run along home,” advised
one of the crowd. “There’s going to be
no scrapping to-day. So cut it out.”</p>

<p>The boy who had helped Harry to his feet
laid a hand on his arm and pulled him away.
“That’ll be about all, kid. Come along.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Harry, resisting for
a moment. “But he can’t do that sort of thing
and get away with it. I’ll get even with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
before I’m through. And I’ll fight him whenever
he likes.”</p>

<p>“You’d put up a grand little fight, wouldn’t
you?” sneered Perry across the shoulder of
one of his crowd. “Say, Fresh, you just keep
away from me or you’ll get hurt, and hurt
badly. Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“I hear you <em>talk</em>,” scoffed Harry. “That’s
all bullies can do!”</p>

<p>Then his rescuer dragged him away just as a
second group of boys came up demanding to
know what the row was about. Harry accompanied
his new friend for some distance in silence.
Finally, moved to defense by the other’s
unspoken censure, “Well,” he muttered, “you
wouldn’t like it yourself, I guess.” His companion
smiled. Then,</p>

<p>“Kid,” he said gravely, “you’ll find a lot of
things you won’t like before you get through
here.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">A week later the awkward squad ceased
to exist. Some few of the members,
discouraged by the sheer irksomeness
of the labor, voluntarily resigned; others, who
showed no football possibilities, were dismissed,
and the rest, perhaps ten in all, went to
Squad C. Among the latter was Harry. Hugh
Barrett, the big left guard, who had reigned
over the awkward ones, had taken a sort of
professional interest in Harry, an interest
evinced by muttered words or grunts of commendation
at first and by sharp criticisms later.
Once he asked the younger boy:</p>

<p>“You fellow in the red shirt! Where’d you
learn to catch a ball that way?”</p>

<p>“At home. I played on my high school
team three years,” answered Harry. Barrett
grunted.</p>

<p>“Three years, eh? How old are you now?”</p>

<p>“Fifteen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>“Must have started young,” muttered Barrett.
“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Danforth.”</p>

<p>“Well, take charge here, Danforth, till I get
back. Keep ’em passing.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Harry had settled down into his
groove at school. Lessons were proving a bit
harder than expected, but, thanks to a summer
of coaching at the hands of one of the high
school instructors, he was keeping up his end.
Tracey Colgan, with whom Harry roomed in
Number 16 Temple Hall, was turning out to be
a much more companionable and likable fellow
than Harry had at first hoped for. Tracey
came from some small town in the vicinity of
Boston and possessed all the frigidity of manner
popularly associated with New Englanders.
But underneath the icy coating was a warm
heart and a liveliness of temperament quite unsuspected.
After Harry got to know him better—and
you can’t room with a chap very long
without getting to know him—he liked him very
much. He was rather tall and thin, good-looking
in a way—nice-looking would be a better
word for it—and excruciatingly clean and neat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
It seemed to Harry that Tracey was forever
bathing or scrubbing, while as for his attire a
badly tied scarf made him positively wretched
and he consumed more time in dressing than
Harry took for his entire morning preparations!
Tracey was rather a grind, which, perhaps,
was fortunate, since just at this time
Harry needed some one to set him an example
in studiousness. Not that Harry didn’t want
to study, for he did. He had no mistaken notions
of what he was at Barnstead for. But
football is a hard taskmaster, he was an enthusiastic
lover of it, and previous success had
made him ambitious to win further honors. In
short, during those first two months of school
he was inclined to spend a little too much time
and energy on football and not enough on his
lessons.</p>

<p>Perry Vose, for Tracey had easily supplied
the name of the boy when Harry had recounted
his adventure, had so far not troubled Harry
again. Once or twice, on the field or in School
Hall, they had passed, but there had been no
display of hostility other than a scowl. After
he had cooled off Harry had been a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
ashamed and regretful of his loss of temper.
As Tracey had pointed out, a new fellow was
liable to a good deal of kidding and even some
roughing-up at the hands of the older boys. It
was all a part of getting settled down. Tracey
thought his chum had escaped rather easily,
and to prove it narrated some fairly hair-raising
hazing exploits that he knew of. As for
the chap who had befriended him that day,
Harry had only glimpsed him once or twice
from a distance, not a surprising fact when it
is considered that Barnstead Academy boasted
of some two hundred and forty pupils.</p>

<p>Of course life wasn’t quite all football for
Harry. Recitations averaged four hours a day
for the Lower Middle Class, of which he was a
member, and the evenings were largely given
over to study. And several times he and Tracey
met on the tennis court in the morning after a
hurried breakfast and played a set or more
before the bell summoned them to first recitation.
And Sundays were in the nature of holidays.
There was church in the forenoon in the
school chapel, but after that the rest of the day
was theirs for whatever orderly recreation they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
chose. Tracey was fond of walking and he
and Harry and Joe Phillips, the football manager,
often took long, wandering trips about
the autumn country. The discovery of chestnut
trees was one of their delights. The burs
had not yet begun to open, but the boys set
down the location of the trees in their minds
and bided their time. As the days went by
Harry’s circle of acquaintances increased in a
haphazard and natural way. You sat next to a
fellow in class and spoke to him about some
trivial matter. Then you nodded to him when
you passed him on the campus. And finally
you dropped into his room by invitation, or he
dropped into yours. And in dining-hall, of
course, it took but one or two days to get on
speaking terms, at least, with the fellows at
your table. At the end of his first fortnight
Harry was surprised to discover how large a
circle of speaking acquaintances he had. Of
real friends he had so far but one, Tracey.
Friendships aren’t made in a day even at preparatory
school. Next to Tracey, Joe Phillips
was the fellow he knew best. Joe, however,
was several years older than Harry and, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
he was a fine chap in every way, Harry experienced
no affection for him. Perhaps Harry
made acquaintances more easily than the average
boy. He was eminently attractive to look
at, had a winning smile, could listen as well as
talk, and was, in short, thoroughly companionable.</p>

<p>On Squad C Harry performed creditably for
a week. Work at the dummy had begun and a
provisional eleven had been made up. The first
game was but a few days away. Harry had
been placed with the halfbacks, a position for
which his experience recommended him. Squad
C began to thin out as the first contest drew
near. Some of the fellows went to the first team
as third substitutes, others went to Squad B,
which had now developed into the second team,
in like capacities, and a few fell out of the race.
Just before the Belton game Harry was taken
on to the second and a few days later Squad C,
like Squad Z, ceased to exist. By that time the
number of candidates had dwindled from sixty-odd
to about forty, and most of those who remained
were certain to last the season out
either on the school team or the second, barring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
accidents. Harry was glad to get into the second
team fold, but he had no intention of remaining
there.</p>

<p>The Belton game, looked on beforehand as
not much more than a good practice, proved a
tough contest and Barnstead won out eventually
by the slim margin of a kicked goal, the
final score being 7–6. That was on a Saturday,
the last Saturday but one in September, and
on the following Monday Coach Worden made
a number of changes in the line-up of the first
team. Several substitutes were given opportunities
to show what they could do, while
Jones, who had exhibited remarkably poor generalship
as quarter in Saturday’s game, gave
place to Bob Peel, a small, freckle-faced youth
with red hair and any amount of vim. Unfortunately,
however, Peel, while a good director,
was only a mediocre player in the backfield,
and that Monday afternoon a fumble by him of
a long punt paved the way for a touchdown by
the second and a subsequent victory. Harry
got in that day at left halfback for a full ten-minute
period, and after the scrimmage was
over the school was relishing the knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
a discovery. For in ten minutes Harry, using
every bit of the daring, reckless courage that
had brought him fame at Hillston, and all the
knowledge he had gained since, dashed through
the first team’s defense or around its drawn-in
ends for long gains time after time and opened
Coach Worden’s eyes to the fact that here was
a youngster worth watching and cultivating.
Hugh Barrett, even when a play with Harry
hugging the ball went through his position,
grunted commendation and nodded his head
knowingly. He had, he told himself, seen from
the first that Danforth had something in him.
So Barnstead Academy took a sensation with
it up the hill and back to the dormitories, and
the sensation was the sudden appearance on
the football horizon of a new star whose name
was Danforth!</p>

<p>Barnstead met Cruger’s School and Thurston
Polytechnic on succeeding Saturdays—there
were no mid-week games—and scored one victory
and met one defeat. The victory was overwhelming
and the defeat, at the hands of Thurston,
a heavier and far more experienced team,
was honorable. Barnstead reached the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of the season hopeful and determined. Harry
was still on the second team and was still making
good. Of course he had much to learn, but
he was learning it fast. And the school at
large, having enjoyed its sensation, settled
down to a hearty admiration of “the kid halfback,”
as they called him and looked for great
things from him. Some criticism was aired because
Worden did not at once move Harry from
the second to the first. There were plenty of
critics who declared that “young Danforth
could play rings around Norman.” Norman
was the present first choice for left half, a hard-working
but not especially brilliant youth who
had already had two seasons on the team. But
Worden, if he heard the criticisms, paid them
no heed. Harry needed training and experience
in fast company before he was ready for
the School Team, and the coach meant that he
should have it. The second eleven worked prodigiously
those days and the first had all it
could do to register anything like a decisive victory.
To be sure, the second had its slumps,
as when, the Tuesday after the Thurston game,
it allowed the first to tally four touchdowns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
and only saved itself from a shut-out by lifting
the ball over the cross-bar for a field goal. To
even matters, however, the first team itself was
only human and sometimes let down in its play
and allowed the second to tie or, infrequently,
to win.</p>

<p>Four games remained on the schedule when
October was half gone: Carver Academy,
Pleasanton High, Norwich Academy and St.
Matthew’s. St. Matthew’s was Barnstead’s
dearly hated rival in every sport and the victor
in most. The Blue triumphed almost yearly
on the track and won more than her share of
the baseball contests. It was only in hockey
and football that the records of the two schools
came anywhere near balancing. At hockey
Barnstead, aided by better ice facilities, was
the master, while at football the Brown had
almost, if not quite, as many wins to her credit
as the Blue. This year, having met defeat last
November, the Brown considered it her turn
to triumph and meant to do so. And to this
end the school worked as one.</p>

<p>And yet there was an exception after all, and
that exception was Perry Vose. Perry was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
eighteen years of age, strongly built, good-looking
in a dark and somewhat surly way and
what the fellows who had seen him perform
called a corking player. But in spite of his
ability Perry was not on the team this year.
Why this was so Harry learned from Tracey.</p>

<p>“He played in the line two years,” said Tracey.
“Left guard, I think. Maybe he was
right. Anyhow, he has a beast of a temper
and can’t hold on to it. In almost every game
he was cautioned for slugging or rough work
of some sort, and several times he was put off.
Worden stood a lot from him because he was
such a dandy player. But last year in the
Pleasanton game he mixed it up with the chap
who played opposite him, the umpire or the referee
caught him, the other chap got a cut lip
and Perry was put off. After the game Worden
told him he needn’t report again until he could
play decently and like a gentleman. Perry
‘sassed’ him for fair, they say; I didn’t hear
it; and Worden told him then that he needn’t
report again for football as long as he was
coaching because he wouldn’t have him. Faculty
heard about it and Perry came mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
near being expelled. He had to apologize to
Worden and went on probation for two months.
That didn’t make him care any more for the
coach, and he still hates him like anything.
Mention Worden to Perry and he will foam at
the mouth!”</p>

<p>And Tracey smiled reminiscently.</p>

<p>“He seems to have a good many friends,
though,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he isn’t such a bad sort when he behaves.
Lots of fellows like him, or pretend to,
because his folks are pretty well fixed and
Perry always has a lot of money to spend. And
he spends it. Still, maybe it isn’t only that. I
dare say lots of fellows like him just for—for
himself. He can be very decent if he wants
to. It’s his old temper that plays hob with
him. You and he had any more trouble?”</p>

<p>“No, he’s let me alone and I’ve let him
alone.”</p>

<p>“Good scheme, chum. He’s a bad man in a
mix-up.”</p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of him,” replied Harry
stoutly. “But I don’t see that there’s any use
in having a fuss. I said I’d get even with him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
some day, and I intend to, but I don’t want to
lose my place on the second on his account.
And it might come to that if we had a row and
faculty heard of it.”</p>

<p>“You’re wise. Keep away from him. And if
he tries to start anything, run. It would be
like him to get you into a rumpus just so
faculty would hear of it and, maybe, put you
on pro. He’d like that because it would lose
Worden a good player.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean Vose would want to see us
beaten just because he dislikes Mr. Worden!”</p>

<p>“Hm; not exactly, perhaps. Still, I wouldn’t
wager much on it! If he could get even with
Worden I dare say he wouldn’t care a continental
whether we won or lost at football!”</p>

<p>“He’s a dandy!” said Harry indignantly.
“If that’s the way it is you can bet I’ll keep
away from him. I’ll even run if necessary!
But if ever I do run from him I’ll run back
again when the football’s over! And then he
will learn something!”</p>

<p>“Easy!” laughed Tracey. “Perry Vose is
three inches taller than you are and three years
older—almost.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“He’s a bully, and I never saw a bully yet
who wasn’t a coward at heart.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t count too much on that, Harry.
He may be a bully, but you’ll find he’s no coward.
And he’s a mean chap in a fight. Take
my advice and let him alone.”</p>

<p>“I mean to—at present,” replied Harry. “I
can’t afford to take any chances. I want to
make the first before the season’s over. Think
I will, Tracey?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see how you can help it. I’m not
much of a football fan, but I hear what the fellows
say, and they all seem to think that you
are some wonder. Guess I’ll have to wander
down to the field and see you in action some
day.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite a sight,” laughed Harry.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.” Tracey was silent a moment.
Then, with a smile, “Funny how my
stock’s gone up lately,” he added.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Why, since the fellows discovered that you
were a star football player I am treated with
much more respect. You see, I happen to be
your roommate. Case of reflected glory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“Fact, though. Wouldn’t be surprised if I
went down to posterity as the fellow who
roomed with Harry Danforth at prep school!
Say, don’t turn me out next year, will you?
Think how I’d feel!”</p>

<p>“You make me sick,” grumbled Harry.
“You’re twice as popular and—and important
as I am.”</p>

<p>“I used to be,” sighed Tracey, “but now I’m
just Danforth’s roommate. Still, fame is fame,
and——”</p>

<p>But just there Harry shied a book at him, and
in the scuffle that followed fame was forgotten.</p>

<p>In the Carver game Harry had his first try
on the School Eleven. Worden put him in at
the beginning of the third quarter at left half,
displacing Norman. Harry did good work
against a team that averaged several pounds
lighter and established himself more firmly than
ever in the affection and admiration of his fellows.
And yet when the fourth period began
it was Norman who went in at the left of quarter
and Harry retired to a blanket and the
bench. Just why this was he couldn’t see, since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
he was conscious of having played well, better,
he honestly believed, than Norman. But facts
were facts, and he saw the last ten minutes of
a rather listless combat from the substitutes’
bench. Barnstead had no trouble rolling up
twenty-seven points and was only scored on
when Jones, who took Bob Peel’s place in the
last period, fumbled the ball on Barnstead’s
thirty yards and a quick-witted and long-legged
Carver forward got it and tumbled through a
broken field for a touchdown. Poor Jones,
whose fortunes were trembling in the balance
before, was a sad-faced youth as the players
trotted back to the gymnasium after the game,
and Harry pitied him. From thence on Jones
was frankly a second-string quarter and Bob
Peel ruled the roost. Football, like life, is a
case of the survival of the fittest, and the boy
who makes good in the first more often than
not makes good in the latter. And the lessons
learned on the gridiron, lessons of obedience to
authority, confidence, unselfishness and self-control,
are lessons that stand one in good
stead in the bigger game to follow. Harry, with
some dim notion of this in his mind, mentally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
compared Jones’ conduct under discipline to
Perry Vose’s. Jones probably had a bad hour
or two with himself, but the next Monday he
turned up smiling and cheerful, and all the rest
of the season he worked hard when work was
given him, served patiently with the waiters on
the bench and never once gave voice to a disgruntled
expression. Jones was a good loser,
which is scarcer than a good winner. And
Harry, looking on, learned a lesson from Jones.</p>

<p>The team had its troubles that week. Plaisted,
the best guard the school had, and, with the
possible exception of Captain Ted Corson, at
fullback, the best player of all, wrenched his
knee in practice on Tuesday and went off for
what the doctor predicted would be a full week.
Parrett, first substitute, took his place at the
right of center and filled it fairly satisfactorily,
but Plaisted was missed. I think that if ever
Worden was tempted to retract his words and
offer Perry Vose his old position it was then.
But he didn’t. Nor did he show any sign of
yielding when, a week later, Plaisted returned
to work, hobbled around rather uselessly and
was finally retired for good with a bad case of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
water on the knee. By that time Pleasanton
High had come and gone with trailing banners
and Barnstead had scored another victory. But
the Pleasanton game, although it had been won
decisively, 15 to 3, proved to Coach Worden
that Parrett was not another Plaisted and that
the right of the line was now its weak place.
Several experiments were tried during the first
of the week, but it was not until Captain Corson
was changed from fullback to right guard that
the difficulty seemed to be solved. Ted Corson
had played guard two years before and so was
no novice in the line. To fill Corson’s place,
Carstairs, right half, was pulled back to full,
and Harry Danforth at last became a member
of the School Team. Norman was moved across
to the other side and Harry went in at left half.
And the school applauded.</p>

<p class="cap">As the Norwich Academy game drew near
the school rose rapidly toward the
zenith of football enthusiasm. Studies
suffered, as they always do at such times, and
the faculty, made wise by experience, was as
lenient as possible. It was less the players and
substitutes themselves who made sorry showings
in the classrooms than the school at large.
It was the non-combatants whose minds refused
to mix football with study, to the detriment of
study. They not only had to watch and speculate
upon the local football situation, but must
keep close tab on the progress of the college
teams as well. Nearly every preparatory
schoolboy is for one reason or another an enthusiastic
partisan of one or other of the universities.
Usually he has selected his college
by the end of his first year at school and from
then on, or until he changes his inclination, he
follows the fortunes of the football heroes representing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
his future alma mater with breathless
interest. So it can readily be seen that the
months of October and November constitute a
busy season for the schoolboy, with the interest
and excitement drawing to a breathless crisis
about the middle of November. Barnstead
Academy talked football, read football and
dreamed football. It had football for breakfast,
dinner and supper, and nibbled on it between
meals! City newspapers with accounts
of the college and big school gridiron doings
were at a premium, while illustrated weeklies,
picturing and describing recent contests, were
passed around from room to room and read
and re-read until torn and tattered.</p>

<p>Tracey Colgan, who had heretofore been as
little enthusiastic about football as anyone in
school, became so deeply interested that he
journeyed day after day to the field to watch the
play of Harry and, incidentally, the rest of the
team. One can’t room with a football player
and listen to his talk without eventually becoming
at least mildly enthusiastic. Harry was
very glad of his chum’s new-found interest,
since it gave him someone to talk things over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
with, someone sympathetic. And Harry was
grateful for sympathy just then, for things
weren’t going any too well and there were many
hours of discouragement. But while sympathetic,
Tracey was also sane.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he would say, “what’s the use
of getting yourself all stirred up about it? Supposing
you don’t keep your place until the St.
Matthew’s game. What’s it going to matter a
year or two from now? There’s no use getting
white hairs and wrinkles over it as far as I can
see.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you’ve never played,” replied
Harry mournfully. “If you had you’d—you’d
understand.”</p>

<p>“I understand that you football chaps are a
lot of crazy idiots for two months every year,”
answered Tracey. “Great Scott, anyone would
think that your blessed lives depended on your
making the first team! Suppose you just stop
a bit and consider the fact that there are about
two hundred fellows here who never looked a
football in the lacings!”</p>

<p>“There aren’t; there are only two hundred
and forty fellows in school and I guess half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of them have played football at some time or
other.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was speaking—er—approximately,”
replied Tracey, undisturbed. “What I’m trying
to make you see is that you and the rest of
your tribe are taking the whole thing much too
seriously and that the world’s going to keep
right on humming around whether you get a
black eye in the St. Matthew’s game or look on
from the grandstand.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough for you,” objected
Harry, “but you don’t see it the way we do.
If you——”</p>

<p>“Or <em>you</em> don’t see it the way the rest of us
do,” laughed Tracey. “All right. Go ahead
and have your conniption fits. But if you keep
on worrying the way you’re worrying nowadays
you’ll not only lose your place on the
team, but you’ll fill an early grave. And flowers
are expensive this time of year.”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying,” replied Harry a trifle
resentfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not at all! You’ve been sitting there
with that book in front of you for forty-five
minutes and you haven’t looked into it once.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Bet you don’t even know whether it’s an algebra
or a French dictionary!”</p>

<p>“I do, too! It’s”—Harry stole a glance at
it—“it’s Cicero.”</p>

<p>“Good stuff! Emulate our old friend then.
Bet you Cicero never lost his head over football.”</p>

<p>“He never lost his head over anything,”
grumbled Harry, “except his silly old orations.”</p>

<p>“He was a wise old party,” returned Tracey,
who had taken a volume of Shakespeare’s
Works and was hunting through the pages.
“And I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew something
about football, either. Here it is. Listen
to this. Mr. Cicero is speaking to Casca.
‘Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time; but men
may construe things after their fashion, clean
from the purpose of the things themselves.’
Yes, sir, I guess they played football where
Cicero went to school!”</p>

<p>“That’s nonsense. Besides, Cicero didn’t
say that; Shakespeare said it.”</p>

<p>“Makes it more probable, then, that the remark
refers to football,” replied Tracey untroubledly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
“For, if I remember right, they
played football in William’s time.”</p>

<p>“You ought to join the Debating Society,”
grunted Harry. “Shut up now, will you, and
let me study.”</p>

<p>Harry’s uneasiness was due to the fact that
a youth named Dyker, familiarly known as
Dutch, was pressing him closely for the position
of left halfback. Dyker had played two
years on the second and had won promotion
that Fall to the first team as substitute. Just
at present Harry and Dyker were alternating
in the coveted position and Harry’s heart was
filled with fear. Dyker had the advantage of
years, being seventeen, and, besides, was a
rather clever punter, something which Harry
made no claim to be. Harry used to dream
about this time that he had sprained an ankle
or broken an arm and that Dyker had ousted
him for the rest of the season, and groan so
loudly in his sleep that Tracey would shy a pillow
across at him and beg him to turn over.</p>

<p>For my part I think that many of Harry’s
fears were groundless and that in pitting the
two boys against each other Worden was only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
trying to develop each to the utmost. Harry’s
dashing brilliancy in a broken field kept him
head and shoulders above his rival, who, even
if he could punt well and might be needed in
the big game for that accomplishment, was only
a fair ground-gainer after all. But Harry
didn’t realize that and there were moments,
when, as it seemed to him, Dyker was pressing
him closely for his place, that Harry could almost
find it in his heart to wish that Dutch
would bust something and retire from the struggle.</p>

<p>Work grew very strenuous that last fortnight.
The dummy was resurrected and hung
again on his twenty-foot railway, and for three
days the first team fellows went back to first
principles, throwing themselves upon the
stuffed and headless figure at the end of the
chain, falling on wabbling, elusive balls and
chasing them across the turf to catch them on
their erratic bounds. And with this primary
instruction went final polishing in signal work
and the development of the attack. And almost
before anyone realized it, it was Saturday and
the day of the Norwich contest, beyond which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
lay but four days of practice before the final
struggle of the football season.</p>

<p>Barnstead turned out to a boy that afternoon,
in spite of a drizzling rain, and practiced
the songs that were to be sung at the St.
Matthew’s game and cheered on the slightest
provocation at the behest of eight tireless, merciless
cheer leaders who, armed with brown
megaphones, waved their arms and shook their
fists and demanded “A regular cheer, fellows,
and make it good!” on the slightest provocation.
Norwich sent over a small but determinedly
noisy group of youths, who answered
every vocal challenge from across the wet
field.</p>

<p>Harry started the game at left half, and provided
the first sensation when, two minutes
after the kick-off, he stole a forward pass and
dodged and squirmed his way through the ruck
of players and sped across seven white lines for
the first score of the game. When, having
placed the pigskin squarely back of the posts
with practically no opposition, he scrambled to
his feet, eight discarded brown megaphones
were tumbling about the turf in front of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
stand and eight red-faced cheer leaders were
leaping and gesticulating, while from some two
hundred eager throats a vast and deafening
roar of sound was sweeping across the field.</p>

<p>Later, in the second twelve-minute period,
Harry again brought the stand to its feet when,
from a double pass behind the line, he got safely
away around his own right end and reeled off
almost thirty yards before he was pulled down
into a puddle. But the most encouraging feature
of that game was the work of Captain Corson
at right guard and of Carstairs at fullback.
Corson was as steady as a wall against the
strong attack of Norwich, while Carstairs, in a
position he had played but a few days, shone
brilliantly. The first half ended with the score
7 to 6, Norwich having failed to kick goal after
her touchdown in the second period.</p>

<p>Worden made several changes in the line-up
when the second half began. A new left tackle
went in, a substitute center was tried, Jones
took Peel’s place at quarter and both halfbacks
were fresh men. Harry viewed Dyker’s substitution
with misgiving as he drew a blanket
about him and settled down to watch the contest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
from the bench. He was a little bit angry
with the coach and looked so glum that Bob
Peel, squeezing himself into a seat between
Harry and a substitute end, ventured consolation.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Danforth,” said the quarter, kicking
him good-naturedly on the ankle. “You
don’t know when you’re well off. All we have
to do is sit here and see those poor chaps work.
It’s fine!”</p>

<p>Harry smiled faintly. “That’s all right for
you, Peel. You’re sure of your place. I’m not.
Just when I get going fairly well Worden yanks
me out and puts in Dyker.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess he wants Dyker to help with
the punting. It’s up to Carstairs, and it won’t
do to work him too hard to-day. As for being
sure of your place”—Peel shrugged his shoulders—“there’s
no such thing, Danforth. Any
of us may wrench a knee or an ankle or something,
and then where are we? Why, it’s the
uncertainty that makes half the fun!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” muttered Harry without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Sure. What the dickens is Carstairs doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
off there? He’s way out of position if that’s a
delayed pass. Thought so! Lost a yard! I
suppose I ought to be sort of pleased when
Jones slips up like that, but I’m not. He’s a
good old sort, Jones. That’s better! Right
through left guard for three! If Dyker would
put his head down and forget to slow up every
time he strikes the line he’d do a heap better.
Let’s see how he boots this. Not bad. Nearly
forty yards, I guess. Seems to me if Worden
took him in hand he could make a real punter
out of Dutch. He’s got another year, hasn’t
he?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” answered Harry. “He does
punt well, doesn’t he? Gets them off quickly,
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if he could plunge as well as he can
kick he’d get a place. As it is I guess you’re
pretty certain to start the game next week.
Here comes that delayed pass again. That’s a
lot better. We ought to have a score coming
to us pretty soon.”</p>

<p>Barnstead was down on Norwich’s thirty-three
yards, and it was first down again. Carstairs
swept around the left of the Norwich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
line for six yards or so, made two through center
and then fell back as though to try a drop-kick.
But the ball went to Simmons, who was
playing right half, and Simmons wormed past
left tackle for the necessary gain. From the
twenty-two-yard line the home team carried
the pigskin to the threshold of a score, only to
lose it a yard from the last line. Norwich held
beautifully. After kicking from behind its goal
line the visiting eleven got the ball on a fumble
near mid-field and started toward Barnstead’s
goal. The Brown’s defense was pretty thoroughly
tested during the ensuing five or six
minutes and Norwich made the thirty yards
without losing possession of the pigskin once.
There, however, the Brown stiffened and, after
two tries that netted but five yards, Norwich
made a forward pass that worked finely and
took the ball half the distance to the goal. But
the Brown line was pretty tight now, and after
being thrice repulsed Norwich tried a desperate
place kick from a difficult angle and missed.
With the ball back in mid-field the quarter
ended.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Bob Peel, “if Worden’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
going to be satisfied with what we’ve got. It’s
taking chances, I say.”</p>

<p>Apparently the coach had determined to play
on the defensive for the remainder of the game
and made no change in the line-up. Harry, who
had hoped to get in again, scowled at Coach
Worden’s back as the latter strolled past the
bench. Peel, seeing, laughed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he the mean old thing, Danforth?” he
asked. “Good thing, though, he didn’t turn
around just then and see your expression. He
might have sacked you for calling him names!”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t,” answered Harry, grinning in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>“Thinking names, then. It’s the same
thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I do think he might let me play,” said
the other. “You, too.”</p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I don’t mind. You see, Danforth,
he’s keeping us out of it because we’re too
precious to take chances with. Looking at it in
that way, you see, it’s a fine old compliment to
our worth and abilities.”</p>

<p>“I don’t look at it that way,” murmured
Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“Might as well. Hello! Look at that!”</p>

<p>A Norwich back, the ball tucked into the corner
of his left arm, was streaking down the
field, evading player after player of the opposing
team and crossing one white line after another,
while the stands broke into wild, unintelligible
tumult! Only Jones, playing well
back, stood between the Norwich runner and
the goal, and hundreds of voices died into silence
as the two forms, one speeding desperately
and one advancing alertly and cautiously,
drew near. Then a great shout of triumph and
relief from the supporters of the home team
broke forth, and Peel murmured: “Good old
Jonesy! Tackled like a man!”</p>

<p>For Jones had brought down the runner on
the twenty-four-yard line with as pretty a
tackle as had been seen all season, and Norwich’s
hope of winning the game died a sudden
death. Coach Worden hurried a new end into
the field in place of Shallcross, and the teams
lined up on the twenty-four yards. But Norwich’s
bolt had been sped. Three attempts at
the tackles gained but six yards, and when the
left half fell back to kicking position and held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
his hands for the ball nearly half the Barnstead
forwards came rushing through upon him and
the ball, striking a leaping figure, went bounding
back up the field. The substitute end fell
on it near the forty yards, and Dyker punted
down the field and out of bounds at Norwich’s
thirty-yard line. Three minutes later the game
was over, and Barnstead had won by the narrow
margin of one point. Harry, trotting back
to the gymnasium in the wake of the players,
forgot his enmity against the coach in the satisfaction
of victory.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">Barnstead celebrated that evening.
Not that the school was unduly elated
because of the victory over Norwich,
nor that the score was anything to be especially
proud of, but merely because football enthusiasm
was rampant and the afternoon’s success,
slight as it was, provided an excuse. As soon
as supper was over the fellows congregated in
front of School Hall and began cheering. Songs
followed the cheers, and then a voice cried:
“We want to march!” The suggestion won
immediate favor, and in almost less time than
it takes to tell it the fellows were falling into
line four abreast, two hundred throats were
singing the school anthem and the march had
begun. Shouting, cheering, singing, pushing
and jostling, the long column swung around the
corner and began the circuit of the campus.</p>

<p>Harry found himself between Tracey, who
had been with him when the celebration began,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and a substitute tackle named Cummings. Linking
arms, they followed on, adding their quota
to the noise and hilarity. The procession
paused at each dormitory to cheer the resident
instructor, and wound four blocks out of bounds
to reach Mr. Worden’s rooms in a little white
clapboarded cottage. The noise soon brought
the coach to the doorway and, when the throng
had quieted down, he made a short speech that
rekindled the waning enthusiasm. After that
the procession headed back to the campus, paid
a visit to the principal’s residence and finally
disbanded in front of School Hall. As it was a
Saturday night there was no imperative need
of studying, and so Harry and Tracey followed
a discordant group of revelers across to Hutchins
Hall and spent an hour with Joe Phillips
and his roommate, Bert Means, talking football
and predicting an overwhelming victory
over St. Matthew’s.</p>

<p>The Sunday morning mail—one called for it
at the office between breakfast and chapel—brought
a letter to Harry from Pete Wilkinson,
back home. Pete had written once before
during the Fall, and as his letters, while rambling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
held a deal of home news, Harry was always
glad to get them. The present epistle,
four full pages in length, detailed the doings
of mutual acquaintances since his last report
and brought the chronicles of the Hillston High
School Football Team down to date. Toward
the end Pete wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fellows think it funny we don’t see more about you in
the papers. We read most everything from around there
and haven’t seen your name in them but once some time
ago. Aren’t you on the team for regular? I see your
name down at left half sometimes and sometimes I see a
fellow named Dyker down. Tom Rawlins told George
High the other day that he’d heard you weren’t making
good and George told him he didn’t know what he was talking
about. And I guess he don’t. Write me how you are
getting on, Harry, and tell me all about everything. Do you
like the school and how many fellows are there there? Who
is your coach? Are you going to try for the hockey team
this winter? I hear that Barnstead is a great place for
hockey. I wish my father would let me go there next year,
but he says it costs too much. How much does it cost,
Harry? Are you coming home at Christmas? Answer soon.
All the fellows want to be remembered to you. Good luck,
Harry, and I hope you do fine a week from to-morrow.
All the fellows say the same. Your friend, Pete.</p></div>

<p>Harry replied that afternoon and answered
Pete’s numerous questions to the best of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
ability. The effect of writing this letter and
a less lengthy one to his father and mother was
to make Harry a little bit homesick, and, after
he had mailed the two epistles, he went off alone
for a long walk through a gray mist that added
very little to his spirits.</p>

<p>But Monday dawned fair and crisp, and the
qualm of homesickness was gone and forgotten.
Practice that afternoon was as hard as any during
the year. Coach Worden was not satisfied
with the team’s defense, and so for the better
part of an hour the second was given the ball
time and time again, on the first team’s thirty
yards, on its twenty and, finally, on its five, and
told to put it over. It did so at last, from the five-yard
line, but not until the first team forwards
were battered and tired out. There was signal
work on the floor of the gymnasium that evening
and on the two evenings following, but the final
hard practice out of doors came on Tuesday.
After that the team were given only enough
work to keep them in shape. There was a fifteen-minute
scrimmage on Wednesday and a
good deal of punting and catching and some
signal practice. All the week it was Harry who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
had the call for left half and Dyker got into
the play but once, for a brief ten minutes or so
on Tuesday. Thursday it rained hard all day,
and the short work at signals planned to take
place on the field was held in the basement of
the gymnasium. In the evening there was a
chalk talk upstairs, during which the players
underwent a pretty stiff examination as to their
familiarity with the plays to be used against
St. Matthew’s. The second team disbanded
Thursday afternoon and had its annual feast in
the visitors’ dining-room. Afterward it moved
in a body to the auditorium at the top of School
Hall and helped make the mass meeting a howling
success. Most of the first team fellows
joined the assemblage after Coach Worden released
them, arriving late, but receiving each
one a deafening cheer as he tried to slip unostentatiously
into a seat at the back of the hall.
All the songs which had ever been sung at previous
games and many new ones were rehearsed,
with the aid of the school Musical Club, and
every player got his share of applause. There
were speeches, too, and it was well toward ten
o’clock when, after singing the school anthem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
the crowd, still joyously noisy, made its way
down the stairs.</p>

<p>Harry, who had arrived at the mass meeting
late and had done his best to reach a seat undetected
and had failed, met Joe Phillips on
the way downstairs and paused at the entrance
to talk to him. Joe had made a speech and
was feeling exhilarated and communicative.
Consequently when Harry started off alone
across the campus for his room most of the fellows
had disappeared. Overhead there were
still a good many heavy, dark clouds floating,
but here and there a frosty star twinkled, and
over the top of Noyes Hall the moon was trying
bravely to make a showing. As Harry
reached the corner of his dormitory he became
aware of three boys ahead of him on the flag
walk. They had almost reached the entrance
when he saw them and the dim light above the
doorway threw their forms into relief without
revealing their faces. They had stopped just
short of the entrance, and as Harry approached,
his rubber-soled shoes making almost no sound
on the flags, one of the three raised an arm and
appeared to throw something at a window.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Startledly, Harry listened for the resultant
crash of breaking glass. But there was no
sound save the scrape of feet as the trio dashed
up the steps and disappeared through the entrance.
Then Harry saw that the window,
which was one of those in Mr. Adams’ bedroom,
was raised at the bottom. The room was dark.
Wondering what mischief the three boys had
been up to, Harry reached the entrance almost
on their heels, just in time to see the
last of the trio, apparently one of the older boys
and rather heavily built, disappear around the
turn of the stairs. There was only time to
note the general build of the youth and the fact
that he wore a dark-brown sweater, at the back
of which, an inch or two above the hem, gleamed
a small white tag. Then they were gone and a
faint snicker of laughter floated down from
above through the empty hall. At that moment
the door of Number 2 opened quickly and
Harry, one foot on the first step, turned to find
Mr. Adams confronting him, Mr. Adams pulling
a faded red dressing-gown about his gaunt form
and scowling angrily.</p>

<p>“You, Danforth?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>The resident instructor’s voice held both surprise
and wrath and Harry, equally surprised
and a trifle disconcerted, replied a bit uncertainly:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams held out a thin arm, from which
the sleeve of his sleeping garment fell away,
and opened his outstretched hand. In it lay a
squashy brown mass. Harry viewed it doubtfully.</p>

<p>“What—what is it, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You know perfectly what it is,” replied the
instructor, his voice shaking with anger. “It
is an apple, a rotten apple! Your aim was so
good, sir, that it landed against my face! A
rotten apple! Outrageous, Danforth, outrageous,
I say!”</p>

<p>“But—but, Mr. Adams——”</p>

<p>“If that is your idea of a joke, Danforth, I
fear we shall have to tame your humor, sir. It’s
insulting, sir, insulting!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t, sir!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t! Oh, certainly not!”</p>

<p>“I was just coming in when you opened your
door and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“But I asked you and you confessed!” replied
Mr. Adams triumphantly. He was growing
calmer, but the crimson spots on his thin
cheeks told plainly that his anger still held.
“Don’t make matters worse by lying, Danforth.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, sir. I didn’t throw it, word of
honor, Mr. Adams!”</p>

<p>“A likely story! Who did, then? This—this
unspeakable abomination”—the instructor’s
long nose seemed to quiver with disgust as he
viewed the object in his hand—“was thrown
into my room, right on to my pillow as I lay in
bed, against my very cheek, sir! Faugh!” He
made as if to hurl the apple through the doorway,
but thought better of it. “I jump from
bed, Danforth, open my door and find you here,
guilt stamped eloquently upon your face! And
now you have the—the brazen effrontery to tell
me you didn’t do it! I shall see that you are
severely punished, sir, and the fact that you
have added lying to your—your gutter-snipe act
will make me no more lenient, sir!”</p>

<p>“But I tell you, sir,” protested Harry, flushing
resentfully, “that I did not do it! You’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
got to believe me, sir! I know that appearances
seem against me, but I was halfway between
your window and the corner of the building
when the apple was thrown, sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” sneered Mr. Adams. “Then you
saw it done, did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—that is——”</p>

<p>“Well? Well? Did you or did you not? Go
on with your story. Let’s see how fertile your
imagination is, Danforth. You didn’t do it
yourself, but you saw it done. Very well; pray
proceed!”</p>

<p>“I—I saw someone in front of the window,
sir, as I came along. They—he ran away and
I came in here and you opened your door and
called my name, and I said, ‘Yes, sir.’ That’s
all I know about it.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Mr. Adams smiled sourly. “And
the boy you saw in front of the window? What
became of him, Danforth?”</p>

<p>“He—he ran away,” faltered Harry;
“quickly.”</p>

<p>“Very quickly indeed! So quickly that, although
I fairly bounded to the window, there
was no one in sight when I reached it; no one,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
I should say, but you. Sounds a likely story,
Danforth, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it, sir,” replied Harry doggedly.
“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“Which way did this—this figment of your
imagination run, sir?”</p>

<p>Harry glanced toward the stairs. Not a
sound came from the upper floors. Mr. Adams
tapped impatiently on the floor with one slippered
foot.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t say, sir,” answered Harry finally.</p>

<p>“You can’t say! You don’t know whether he
entered this dormitory or not?”</p>

<p>“I——” Again Harry hesitated. Even if
he told what he knew it was unlikely that the
boys could be detected now. “I think they
came in here, sir.”</p>

<p>“You think! Don’t you know whether they——
Look here, you said before that there
was but one boy! Now how many were there?
Careful, Danforth! You’re getting mixed!”</p>

<p>“There was more than one; I think three.
They came in here, sir. That’s all I can say.”</p>

<p>“You saw them enter this dormitory?” pursued
Mr. Adams relentlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Did they turn to the right or to the left?
Or did they go upstairs?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, sir. They—they came in
ahead of me.”</p>

<p>“That will do, my boy. Go on to your room.
You’ll hear more of this—this pleasant little
escapade, this gentlemanly trick—in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t you believe me, sir?” asked
Harry desperately.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams smiled sarcastically. “Oh, perfectly,
Danforth, perfectly! You tell a most
convincing story, I assure you. Dear me, yes,
most convincing. Let us hope, Danforth, that
you’ll be able to do as well before the Principal
in the morning. But don’t try to embroider
it any more, Danforth. It’s quite elaborate
enough as it is.” The instructor smiled broadly
but disagreeably. “I shall—ah—preserve this
odoriferous memento of my pleasant experience,
this slight token of your respect and regard,
Danforth, as Exhibit A. I’ve no doubt your
Principal will view it with interest. Good
night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Adams’ door closed with dignity, but as
it had shut upon a corner of the dressing-gown
and had to be reopened, the effect was somewhat
marred. Harry, smarting with the injustice
of the instructor’s conviction, apprehensive
of what would follow and generally discouraged,
sought his room. The light was
turned low and Tracey was sleeping audibly.
After a moment of indecision, for he wanted
very much to tell his story and get sympathy,
Harry undressed as noiselessly as possible and
tumbled into bed without arousing his chum.
But sleep didn’t come easily that night. Disturbing
thoughts of what might lie in store for
him kept him wakeful, and when, long after
eleven had struck, he fell into slumber, equally
disturbing visions haunted his sleep.</p>

<p class="cap">“You haven’t much to go on,” said Tracey
the next morning. “You don’t
know whether the fellows stopped on
this floor or went on to the third. And as for
the brown sweater, why, there are at least a
hundred in school. You might look for a
sweater with a white tag on it, I suppose. I
don’t understand the tag business. Sweaters
don’t have tags on them except when you buy
them, do they? Did it look like a new one?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell,” replied Harry. “It was
dark on the stairs and I only saw the chap for
a second.”</p>

<p>“Adams is a pig-headed old codger, anyway,”
said Tracey disgustedly. “You couldn’t
convince him that you didn’t do it unless you
had the fellow who did do it and go and make
an affidavit before a notary! You’re up against
it, chum, I guess. Perhaps, though, Dobs”—the
Principal was called Dobs for short—“will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
believe you. He isn’t a bad sort, Dobs. Neither
is Adams, for that matter, except that he’s as
stubborn as a mule and as full of dignity as a—a
camel!” At any other time Harry might have
protested at the simile, but this morning he was
too down in the mouth to care. “I suppose,”
went on Tracey, “that Adams didn’t mind being
hit with the apple much, but the fact that
it was rotten offended his blessed dignity. If
you’d only chucked a green apple——”</p>

<p>“I tell you I didn’t!” cried Harry exasperatedly.
“I don’t know anything about it!
I——”</p>

<p>“I know! I meant to say it was a pity the
fellow who did it didn’t throw a green one,” answered
Tracey soothingly. Harry grunted.
After a moment’s thought: “I suppose that
even if you found out who the fellow was,” continued
Tracey, “it wouldn’t do you much good.
I don’t suppose he’d ’fess up to it.”</p>

<p>“He’d have to if I knew him,” replied the
other grimly. “Why, confound it, Tracey, if
Dobs thinks I’m lying he will—will——”
Harry choked. Tracey nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Pro,” he answered. “I know. Off goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
your head! No more football. It’s—it’s a
shame, old man!”</p>

<p>“And Adams will tell his story and I won’t
have a show at all,” mourned Harry. “If—if
he says I can’t play any more I won’t stay here,
Tracey! I—I’ll leave!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, chum. After all,
you know, things like this are likely to happen
to a fellow occasionally. And as for football,
why, there’s another year coming, and——”</p>

<p>“You make me tired! Another year coming!
Just when I’ve beaten Dyker out for my position,
and the St. Matthew’s game comes to-morrow!
No, sir, if he says I can’t play to-morrow
I’ll quit, Tracey! It isn’t fair! I didn’t do
anything and they’ve no right to punish me for
something I didn’t do! You—you just wait and
see!”</p>

<p>“You’ll think differently later, I guess,” said
Tracey sympathetically. He put an arm
through Harry’s. “Come on and have some
breakfast. You’ll feel better after that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any breakfast,” sighed Harry.
But he allowed the other to draw him to the
door and down the stairs and across to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
dining-room. And afterward, had he thought
about it, he would have had to confess that
Tracey’s prediction had been a true one. For
he did feel better, a whole lot better, and even
began to look forward to his visit to the office
with more assurance. After all, he had done
nothing, and Dobs would just have to believe
him!</p>

<p>But, sad to state, Dobs didn’t, although I
really think he wanted to and tried his best to.
Circumstantial evidence was overwhelmingly
against Harry and Mr. Adams had told his side
of the story convincingly. Moreover, Harry’s
desire to shield the real perpetrators led to
complications. He owned to having seen three
boys at the instructor’s window and the Principal
wanted to know directly why he had not
stated that number to Mr. Adams last night.
Harry had difficulty in explaining that satisfactorily,
and, while it was a small matter, it
caused the Principal to entertain doubts of
Harry’s candidness. In the end the Principal,
regretfully, as even Harry could see, gave the
only verdict possible: Guilty! Harry was sentenced
to a month’s probation, which meant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
many hardships of which but one affected him
seriously. Boys on probation were not allowed
to represent the school on any athletic team.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, Danforth,” said the Principal
gently. “Let this be a lesson to you, my
boy. Take your punishment like a man, and
play the game! Remember that it is adversity
that is the real test of us all!”</p>

<p>Harry made no audible reply, but walked out
of the office mutinous and defiant. He would
not stay there a single hour longer, he told himself
hotly. Everyone was unjust and unfair.
He hated the whole school and everyone and
everything connected with it! He would go
back to his room, pack his bag and leave immediately!
But the next moment recollection of
the folks at home, of what they would think of
his conduct, came to him. His parents wouldn’t
understand, of course. They might even—yes,
he greatly feared they’d insist on his coming
back! Plainly, home was not the place to go to
if—if he did shake the dust of Barnstead from
his shoes. And if he didn’t go home where was
he to go? He had a little money, about eight
dollars, but that wouldn’t last long; in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
when he stopped to think about it, it wouldn’t
much more than take him home! And home—Harry
shook his head and sighed—home didn’t
look very good to him. He could imagine just
the way his father would frown and click his
lips impatiently. Mr. Danforth had never
played football, had hardly, in fact, even seen
a game, and Harry was pretty certain that he
would never understand the motives prompting
his son to give up a school career in the middle
of the first term! And besides, he had, he reflected,
grown rather fond of the school and—and
some of the fellows. And, after all, Dobs
wasn’t really a bad sort; and Dobs had told
him to “play the game.” Running away
wouldn’t be playing the game, and so—so—well,
he guessed he’d stay!</p>

<p>The Principal rendered his verdict just before
ten o’clock. By eleven, so quickly does
news circulate at school, it was very generally
known that young Danforth was on probation
for something he had done to offend Old
Adams. School sentiment was divided. Some
fellows condemned Harry unheard for risking
his place on the team and thereby putting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
morrow’s game in jeopardy. Others, and these
were mostly fellows who had at some time or
other run foul of Mr. Adams in study hall, declared
that the instructor was always looking
for trouble and that it was a fair wager that
whatever Danforth had done he did not deserve
the punishment meted out to him. But of course
it was to Coach Worden and Captain Corson
that the tidings brought the most dismay. To
lose a first-string halfback on the very eve of
the Big Game was a misfortune to try their patience
and fortitude. But as there was no help
for it Mr. Worden promptly drew a line through
Danforth and wrote Dyker after it. And presently,
having discussed and mourned the loss
of the left half to its heart’s content, the school
at large accepted the situation, perked up and
again set its gaze confidently on the morrow.</p>

<p>The mass meeting that night was the biggest
and most enthusiastic of any. Coach Worden
addressed the fellows, as did Captain Corson
and several members of the faculty. Neither
Harry nor Tracey attended. Harry for the
reason that probation confined him to his room
after supper, and Tracey because he didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
want to leave his chum to moon there alone.
But I fancy that these two boys were the only
absent ones that evening, and they were probably
not greatly missed. Certainly the two hundred
and odd occupants of the hall managed to
make plenty of noise without them! After they
had cheered and sung to their heart’s content
indoors they piled downstairs and out on to the
campus and began all over again. Tracey went
to the window and watched them massed in
front of School Hall, but Harry remained at
the table where, for an hour past, he had been
making a weak pretense of studying. It had
not been a very cheerful evening for Tracey,
for Harry was far too downhearted to be good
company and conversation had languished
early.</p>

<p>“There goes Mr. Warren after them,” announced
Tracey with a chuckle. “He will break
that up quick time.”</p>

<p>“Hope he does,” grunted Harry. “How’s a
fellow going to study with that beastly noise
going on?”</p>

<p>Tracey’s prediction proved correct. The
cheers died suddenly away at the instructor’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
advent across the yard and the crowd broke
into small fragments and dissolved quietly. Yet
not altogether quietly, either. For presently,
from the upper end of the campus, came one
shrill and defiant cheer:</p>

<p>“<em>Rah, rah, rah! Warren!</em>”</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VI</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">The day of the St. Matthew’s game
dawned fair and crisp. There was a
little breeze blowing out of the northwest,
but it was not of sufficient strength to
have any influence on the play, unless, as
seemed improbable, it increased by afternoon.
The team piled into a coach and were driven
over to the neighboring village of Turner,
where they were to have their luncheon at the
little hotel, returning afterward just in time to
warm up before the contest. St. Matthew’s began
to put in an appearance about eleven, with
the arrival of the first eastbound express. The
village, bedecked with brown flags and bunting,
began to show specks of blue. The game was
to start at two o’clock, and by one the first of
the invaders appeared in the persons of two
small and enthusiastic youths, who carried blue
flags, wore blue arm bands and who marched
the length of the campus before proceeding to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
the field, critically viewing the buildings and
being greeted with loud and ironic cheers from
various windows. After that the stream from
the village set in in earnest and the blue flags
fluttered into the field by the dozens. But for
every blue one there were at least twenty
brown, and later, when St. Matthew’s started
the cheering, the heroic efforts of her supports
were drowned by the deafening response that
swept across the field.</p>

<p>Harry and Tracey reached the field early and
were lucky enough to find seats at the end of
the third row in the stand. There were plenty
of empty seats toward the top, but the boys
wanted to be as near the play as possible. At
twenty minutes to two the St. Matthew’s players,
first-string men and substitutes, some
thirty in all, trotted through the end gate to the
cheers of the blue contingent across the white-streaked
turf. Five minutes later the brown-clad
warriors appeared, Corson in the lead, and
eight earnest, imploring cheer leaders seized
their megaphones and summoned such an outburst
that the players, doffing their blankets on
the side line, viewed the sloping, brown-flecked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
bank in surprise. Then came a cheer for St.
Matthew’s, and then St. Matthew’s answered
it with one for Barnstead. The local band
struck up a march, flags fluttered and waved,
late comers crowded the aisles and the rival
teams went through their warming-up practice.
Brown ovals arched against a cloudless blue
November sky and the thud of leather against
leather punctuated the shrill cries of the quarterbacks
as they trotted their squads over the
field.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all Harry glanced up to see
a group of three fellows pushing their way up
the aisle past his seat. They were laughing
merrily and paying not too much attention to
the comfort of those in front of them, being
evidently determined to get seats at any cost
of politeness. One of the boys, daring the conventions,
wore only a brown woolen sweater
over his vest, and as on such an occasion, when
parents and friends attended who could, Barnstead
was very particular to look her best,
Harry looked again and a trifle disapprovingly
at the big youth. The latter turned just then
to make a laughing remark to one of his companions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
and Harry saw his face. He was Perry
Vose. That in a measure explained the costume,
for Perry was known to take delight in
defying school conventions. As Harry’s gaze
left Perry’s countenance there was a momentary
rift in the ascending file, and the
younger boy’s eyes fell on a tiny square of
white just above the bottom of the brown
sweater at the back. Instantly he was on his
feet, Tracey viewing him curiously. One by one
the throng in the aisle found accommodations
at left or right, but the three boys kept on,
doubtless seeking places together. Harry
watched, his heart thumping against his ribs,
and ascended two or three steps in order to see
better. Tracey was anxiously demanding what
was up, but Harry paid no heed to him. Then
suddenly he had a clear, unobstructed view of
Perry Vose climbing the stand above him.
There was the brown sweater with the white
tag just as he had glimpsed it the other night
at the turn of the dormitory stairs. And there
was the rather heavy, thick-set body he had
seen. The last doubt fled and Harry started
impetuously after Perry. But a few tiers beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
he stopped and reconsidered. Then, descending
again to his place, he spoke softly to
Tracey.</p>

<p>“You know Perry Vose, don’t you?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty well. Why?” Tracey viewed
his chum’s excited face uneasily.</p>

<p>“I want you to go up there—I’ll show you
where he is—and tell him someone wants to
speak to him at the gate. Don’t say who it is.
Tell him you don’t know. Tell him any old
thing, only get him down to the gate, and do it
quick!”</p>

<p>“Well, but what——”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask questions, Tracey; just do what
I say, like a good pal, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, yes, I suppose so. But look
here, Harry, don’t get into any fuss with Perry.
What do you want to see him about?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later. Go on, please. I’ll wait
down at the gate. Hurry up; there goes the
whistle!”</p>

<p>Doubtfully Tracey left his seat and Harry
pointed out where Perry Vose sat near the top
of the grandstand between his two companions.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
Then Tracey climbed the aisle and Harry
sought the gate.</p>

<p>On the gridiron St. Matthew’s was just kicking
off to the Brown. Harry heard the thud
of the blue-jerseyed youth’s shoe against the
pigskin and saw the ball arch into low flight
down the field. Then the crowd about the entrance
hid the rest from him. Minutes sped
and Vose didn’t appear. Thrice the whistle
shrilled beyond the barrier of spectators and
Harry incuriously wondered what was happening.
Then a brown sweater came into sight
around the corner and Perry Vose, an impatient
frown on his face, was searching for the
person who had sent for him. Back of Perry,
hovering anxiously about the corner of the
stand, Harry spied Tracey.</p>

<p>“Vose!”</p>

<p>Perry found the voice and stared doubtfully
as Harry strode up to him.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said. “What do you want,
kid?”</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you a minute. Come
outside here, will you?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t time. I’m looking for someone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered Harry.
“You’re looking for me.”</p>

<p>“The dickens I am!” Perry stared blackly.
“Do you mean you had the cheek to send and
get me down here?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got a few words for you, Vose.
Will you come outside, please?”</p>

<p>“If I do I’ll give you what for!” declared
Perry angrily. But he followed the younger
boy through the gate and around to the back
of the stand. “Now, what is it?” he demanded
shortly.</p>

<p>“I guess,” began Harry, “that you heard I
was put on probation and so lost my place on
the team.”</p>

<p>Perry nodded, a gleam of understanding in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I worked hard for that place, Vose,
and I want to play. And what’s more, I mean
to.”</p>

<p>“Fine! Go ahead, kid. I don’t object,”
laughed Perry.</p>

<p>“I can’t unless you go with me to Mr. Adams
or the Principal and tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“Tell the truth? Say, what the dickens are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
you talking about? I haven’t got time to stay
here and hear your silly troubles. I want to
see the game, kid.” And Perry moved away.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Vose!” Perry stopped uncertainly.
“Either you do what I say or—or you
fight!”</p>

<p>Perry stared in amazement. The other boy’s
eyes, however, stared back just as hard and unfalteringly.
Perry tried bluster.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,
kid. You must be plumb crazy! What have
I got to do with your playing on the team?
Say, you make me tired. I ought to punch
your silly head for you, that’s what I ought to
do! And I’ll do it, too, if you bother me any
more!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You may have a chance
to try. But what you’ve got to do is go with
me to Mr. Adams——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it! What would I do that for?”</p>

<p>“To tell him you shied that apple at him,” replied
Harry quietly. “I’m being punished for
what you did and it isn’t fair, Vose.”</p>

<p>“Shied—— Say, what are you talking
about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“You know very well. You threw that rotten
apple into his room the other night. I saw you
do it. He thought it was me and told Dobs.
Now——”</p>

<p>“Poppycock! I never saw your old apple!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did. And either you own up and
let me out or you fight.”</p>

<p>“Fight, eh?” Perry scowled fiercely down
at Harry. “Then I guess I’ll fight, kid. And
if I do you’ll be an awful messy-looking youngster
when I get through.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you may be able to lick me——”</p>

<p>“I’ll half kill you,” growled Perry.</p>

<p>“And then again you may not,” continued
Harry. “Anyway, I’ll make a bargain with
you. If you lick me I’ll keep still and won’t
tell. If I lick you you’ll go with me to Mr.
Adams and own up. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Perry laughed ironically, but his gaze swept
the lithe, clean-cut figure before him, and there
was a hint of grudging admiration in his tones
when he answered.</p>

<p>“Sure, that’s a bargain! You meet me here
right after the game, kid, and I’ll give you
what’s coming to you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“After the game won’t do,” replied Harry
firmly. “It’s got to be right now.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, kid! I want to see what’s going
on, and——”</p>

<p>“You’ll fight right now, behind the gym,
Vose; that is, if you’re not afraid to!”</p>

<p>“Afraid! Afraid of you!” Perry flushed
angrily. “Why, you—you——” He paused,
cast a longing look toward the gate, from beyond
which a thunderous cheer broke onto the
air at the moment, and then turned curtly on
his heel. “Come on,” he said.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VII</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">Confidence is a fine thing. The only
danger of it is that it is likely to get
too ripe; in which case it becomes overconfidence
and loses battles. And in spite of
the late-season loss of Parrett and the eleventh-hour
loss of Danforth, Barnstead went on to
the field that Saturday afternoon overconfident.
Why, it would be difficult to say. There seemed
no really good reason for it, for it was well
known that St. Matthew’s had more than an
average team this year, with, besides, the prestige
of more victories than defeats to her credit.
Facts are facts, however, explainable or not,
and the fact in this case is that the Brown faced
its opponent at the kick-off with far too good
an idea of its own ability. And when the awakening
came it left Barnstead for the moment
dismayed and disorganized.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was lucky that the awakening arrived
early, in short at the end of the third minute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
of the play. Bob Peel had taken the kick-off
and had run it in fifteen yards. Then two
plunges at the Blue line and a dash around the
left end had netted but seven yards and Carstairs
had punted well into St. Matthew’s territory.
Treat, the Brown’s left end, was on the
back the moment the ball fell into the latter’s
arm and tackled so hard that a fumble resulted.
Norman picked up the pigskin on the run and
was not stopped until the Blue’s quarterback
brought him to earth near the twenty-yard line.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing on the Barnstead
stand and Bob Peel hurried his men into place
and threw Carstairs at the middle of the Blue
line. But although the fullback gained three
yards then and two more on left tackle, it was
plain that the St. Matthew’s line was stronger
on defense than it had been credited with being.
A forward pass failed and Peel chose to kick
from the seventeen yards. What happened
then was one of those sudden reversals of fortune
that make football the uncertain and exciting
game it is.</p>

<p>Surber passed low, Carstairs was consequently
slow in getting the ball away and half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the Blue line came charging through. The ball
struck someone and bounded back up the field.
A blue-legged forward took it on the bound,
eluded the frantic tackle of Dyker, and tore off
up the gridiron. For the first twenty or thirty
yards it seemed certain that he would be pulled
down from behind, for at least four Barnstead
players were hot upon his heels. But when he
had passed the middle of the field he was virtually
alone, and although friend and foe alike
trailed after him over one white line after another,
he was never headed and so went stumbling,
breathless and tuckered, between the
Brown’s goal posts for a touchdown.</p>

<p>It had all happened so quickly, so unexpectedly
that for a moment Barnstead supporters
merely stared at each other, while from across
the field came wild pæans of joy from where
blue flags waved and tossed ecstatically. St.
Matthew’s could hardly fail of kicking the goal
and in another minute the scoreboard proclaimed:
Barnstead, 0; Visitor, 7.</p>

<p>If the effect on the Brown’s supporters was
numbing the effect on the home team itself
was, for a few minutes, paralyzing. Surber<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
messed the kick-off and the ball went to the
Blue on her thirty-eight yards, from where,
playing like streaks of lightning, and using a
quick shift that left Barnstead hopelessly at a
loss how to meet it, she tore off gain after gain
until suddenly the Brown was well back in her
own territory, literally digging her toes in the
turf in a vain endeavor to stop the triumphant
rush of the oncoming adversary. Down near
the twenty-five-yard line Barnstead did finally
find herself long enough to momentarily stay
the Blue. But, finding the opposing line
strengthening, St. Matthew’s swept past Shallcross’s
end and made its first down on the
twenty yards. Three plunges netted short
gains and then a long forward pass across the
field gave the Blue the rest of her distance.
Barnstead made her final stand on her twelve-yard
line. The fight she put up then brought
back hope to the breasts of her friends. Thrice
the Blue was hurled back for less than two
yards of total gain and St. Matthew’s was
forced to try a field goal. Her kicker went back
to the twenty-five yards and dropped the ball
easily over the cross-bar for another three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
points. And the scoreboard changed its legend
to Barnstead, 0; Visitor, 10.</p>

<p>On the kick-off Surber sent a long one that
let the Brown’s ends down the field, and when
St. Matthew’s lined up it was on her twenty-two
yards. The stand she had made almost
under the shadow of her goal had given the
Brown courage again, and now the Blue’s efforts
were less availing. But nevertheless the
battle swayed back up the field, even if slowly.
It was taking St. Matthew’s the full four downs
now to make her distance, and she was using
every play she had, every ounce of strength
and every bit of cunning in the endeavor to
strike again while her adversary was weak, arguing,
no doubt, that with a sixteen or seventeen
point lead she would not have to do much
later but play on the defensive. But the quarter
ended with the ball near the middle of the
field and gave the demoralized Brown warriors
a few moments in which to confer and get their
bearings. Coach Worden sped in a substitute
for Shallcross, who was having very much of
an off-day, and the substitute doubtless bore
instructions from the general on the side line,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
for the blanketed team crowded around him
when he came on.</p>

<p>The second quarter showed a vast improvement
in the Brown. She had apparently found
herself again. The line played lower and closer
and, although bunching the backs up to the line
gave St. Matthew’s a better opportunity for
forward passes, that opportunity was taken advantage
of but once. Two minutes after the
whistle piped Barnstead had gained the ball on
downs and the brown flags waved triumphantly.
Five minutes later still Barnstead was knocking
importunately at St. Matthew’s portal. But
the door didn’t open, and so, to continue the
metaphor, the Brown entered by way of the
window, Norman dropping a pretty field goal
from a difficult angle and placing a 3 on the
scoreboard where a moment before an obnoxious
0 had been. But that ended the scoring in
that half for either team. The battle raged
fiercely from one thirty-five yards to another,
each team showing the strain, St. Matthew’s
punting on the slightest provocation and Barnstead
hurling her backs at the line in an effort
to wear down her adversary. The whistle put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
an end to her hopes, however, with the ball in
the Brown’s possession on St. Matthew’s thirty-eight
yards. Had the period lasted five minutes
longer the wearied Blue line must have
given way. With fifteen minutes in which to recuperate,
however, there was no telling what the
final outcome would be.</p>

<p>It was almost at the instant that the whistle
terminated the first half that the door bell
tinkled at the Principal’s house. The Principal,
kept away from the first part of the game by a
press of business, was drawing on his coat in
the hallway when the maid opened the door, revealing
two boys.</p>

<p>“Is the Doctor at home, please?” asked a
voice.</p>

<p>The maid turned inquiringly and the Principal
nodded. “Tell them to come in,” he said.
Discarding his coat, he led the way to his study,
the callers following.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please,” said the Principal.
“Now, then—— Hello, young gentlemen;
what’s this? Has there been an accident?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered the younger, who was
by far the more self-possessed of the two. “I—we—that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
is, sir, we had—had a slight misunderstanding
and——” His voice trailed into
silence while the Principal gazed from one disfigured
countenance to the other. I think the
Principal’s sense of humor—a sense popularly
supposed not to belong to a Principal—saved
the day for the boys. A slight smile trembled
about the Principal’s mouth and he said dryly:</p>

<p>“A <em>slight</em> misunderstanding, eh? How fortunate
it was not a serious one! What is your
name, my boy? Vose I have the honor of knowing.”</p>

<p>“Danforth, sir. Could I—would you please
let me tell you about it? We tried to find Mr.
Adams, but he was not in, and so we came to
you.”</p>

<p>“Explain by all means,” replied the Principal,
settling himself in the big leather chair
with a sigh of resignation. “But please be as
brief as possible, Danforth.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. This is the way
it all came about, sir. You see——”</p>

<p>“Really, my boy, I’m afraid I haven’t time
to hear any family histories. Suppose you
come and see me this evening after supper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“But that will be too late, sir! I want to get
to the field and——”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I want,” replied the Principal
with a smile. “So——”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much to tell, sir,” interrupted
Perry doggedly. “I threw that rotten apple
at Old—at Mr. Adams, and he thought Danforth
did it, and you put him on pro and he lost
his place on the team——”</p>

<p>“Succinct, indeed, Vose!” said the Principal
approvingly. “And now you come to tell me so
I’ll let Danforth get into the game, I presume?
But what about this—this slight misunderstanding?
I presume that you are both of
you aware that fighting is not countenanced
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Harry eagerly, “but there
wasn’t anything else to do! And we thought
you’d understand it if we came to you and told
you all about it, sir. He—he didn’t want to
own up to it, and so I—we decided we’d have a—just
a small, harmless sort of a scrap, sir,
and if I won it he was to come with me and put
me right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm; and I presume, although your appearances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
might leave me in doubt, that you—er—won,
Danforth?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, yes, sir. But he put up a dandy—I
mean it was very close.”</p>

<p>“He’s too quick for me,” growled Vose. “He
won all right.” And he felt gingerly of his
nose, which had a reddened and swollen look.</p>

<p>The Principal glanced at the clock on his
desk. “Well, one thing is certain, boys. None
of us will see that game if we stay here much
longer.” He pressed a button and a bell tinkled
somewhere at the back of the house. “Minnie
will take you to the bathroom. I’d advise you
to bathe your faces before returning to society.
Here she is. Run along now.”</p>

<p>“And—and may I play, sir?” asked Harry
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. You’d both better come back
Monday morning and we’ll look into this a little
more closely. For the present the matter
stands. Go ahead and play, Danforth, if they
need you. We’ll thresh all this out another
time.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VIII</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">The scoreboard still told the same tale,
and the third period was half gone.
Down near the St. Matthew’s thirty-yard
line the Brown was charging desperately,
and one white streak after another was passing
slowly, but, as it seemed, surely, under the
grinding feet of the two teams. St. Matthew’s
was on the defensive indeed, for the intermission
had failed to bring back more than a little
of the power and snap of their early performance.
It was with them now only a question of
keeping the Brown at bay, but the Brown was
becoming more difficult every minute. What
Coach Worden had said to them in the gymnasium
between the halves will probably always
remain a secret, but the result was plain to all.
At last Barnstead was playing as she could
play, as she might have played from the first.
But the Fates were still against her. Over-eagerness
had thrice brought penalties for off-side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and once she had lost a down by the
merest fraction of an inch on the tape measure.
But, undismayed, she was fighting royally,
pressing the Blue before her, determined on
crossing that last white line. Bob Peel, disdaining
the points a field goal might bring, continued
to hurl his backs against the Blue line,
which gave way grudgingly, fighting over every
foot of yielded territory. Carstairs piled
through left guard for four, Dyker made a scant
yard off tackle, Norman hurled himself past
left guard for two, Peel got four more around
his own right end. The pigskin was over the
twenty-yard line now and the Barnstead cohorts
were shouting themselves hoarse, the
cheer leaders waving and leaping, purple-faced,
perspiring, almost voiceless. Coach Worden,
squatting near the thirty yards, felt a hand on
his arm and looked around. The boy beside
him had already addressed him twice without
result.</p>

<p>“Hello, Danforth! What is it?”</p>

<p>“I’m off probation, Mr. Worden. Please may
I play, sir?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Off probation? Why—I don’t know,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
Danforth. Yes, I guess we can use you pretty
soon. You’re sure you’re all right with the
Office?” Mr. Worden observed him sharply.
There had been trouble one year when a player
had allowed his desire to play to get the better
of veracity.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ve just come from Dobs, sir. He
said I might.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me as though you’d been playing
already. What under the sun have you been
doing to your face? You ought to have something
on that eye, my boy, or it will be a sight
by suppertime.” His glance fell to the hand
which rested on the canvas knee beside him.
“Hm; I see; been mixing it up with someone,
eh? Think you can do anything if I let you go
in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! I’m all right. Just give me a
chance, Mr. Worden.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “All right. Warm up a
bit. I guess Dyker’s about all in.”</p>

<p>Mr. Worden turned again to the game, and
Harry, shedding his sweater even more quickly
than he had wormed into it at the gymnasium
five minutes before, began to limber up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>Barnstead had thrust her way onward to the
Blue’s eight yards in three plays and a touchdown
was imminent. The St. Matthew’s captain
entreated his men to hold, to throw them
back. But the Blue was weary and sore and
when, on the next play, Carstairs hit the center
of the line it bent inward like cardboard, and
he went sprawling through it and over the last
line for a touchdown. How Barnstead shouted!
The players turned and went leaping back up
the field, patting and thumping each other,
turning handsprings in their delight. But two
minutes later, when the blue-stockinged players
had ranged themselves along their goal line
and Norman’s toe had sent the ball away from
under Peel’s finger, the joy sensibly diminished,
for the pigskin floated yards from its
course and passed to the left of the further upright.
St. Matthew’s was still a point to the
good and the blue flags across the field waved
valiantly.</p>

<p>The quarter ended after the kick-off had been
received and Norman had bounded back up the
field some twenty yards. Behind the further
stand the sun had dipped long since, and a mellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
glow held the world. The ball was taken
to its new location at the other end of the field,
the teams, blanketed, panting, slowly following.
Captain Corson was looking inquiringly, anxiously
toward the side line. Then his unspoken
question was answered. Three figures scuttled
on to the gridiron; Shallcross was coming back
at left end, Jones was succeeding Bob Peel at
quarter and Danforth was relieving Dyker.
Harry’s appearance caused only mild surprise.
Corson and his players had other things to interest
them than the vagaries of the faculty.
All Corson said was:</p>

<p>“Good work, Danforth! Who’s out? Dyker?
All right. Show us how you do it, kid! Any
instructions?”</p>

<p>“Jones has them,” replied Harry, running
on to report to the officials. The whistle summoned
the teams again. Jones, his face alight
with the inspiration given him by the coach
the moment before, sang out his signals
cheerily.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Barnstead! Every fellow into
it hard! We’ve got the game for the asking!
Second formation! Get up there, Jimmy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Ready, St. Matthew’s? Ready, Barnstead?”</p>

<p>“All right, sir!” The whistle shrilled. “Second
formation! 21—54—76—98! 21—54——”</p>

<p>Carstairs had the ball and was sliding off
right tackle.</p>

<p>“Second down! Six to go!” called the referee.</p>

<p>Past the center of the field Barnstead worked
her way, Carstairs, Norman and Harry hitting
the line or slanting off the tackles for short and
certain gains, and Jones twice making his way
on wide end runs. It seemed that St. Matthew’s
was always on the point of going to pieces, and
yet time and again she responded to the hoarse
commands and implorations of her quarter or
captain and held her adversary to short gains.
But that march down the field took time. St.
Matthew’s used up the moments as best she
could with injuries and substitutions. She had
almost a new team in the field when the last
period was half gone, but the new men, if
fresher, were less skillful.</p>

<p>On the forty yards Norman fumbled on the
third down and Carstairs was forced to punt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
St. Matthew’s made a fair catch, taking no risks
now, tried an end run and failed, gained a few
yards on a forward pass and then kicked to the
middle of the field. There Harry, playing back,
caught the punt and wormed his way along past
three white marks before he was thrown. Then
the advance began again. Only seven minutes
remained now and the ball was a long ways
from the Blue’s goal. On the forty yards an
off-side penalty set Barnstead back again, and
a groan went up from the stand. Then a wide
end run from a fake forward pass regained the
penalty distance and four yards besides. Norman
was hurt and went off, and Belding took
his place. A new center went in at the same
time, Surber, who had played a wonderful
game, being relieved by White.</p>

<p>Belding’s first try at the line resulted in a
fumble, and although Jones fell on the ball
Barnstead had lost seven yards. Carstairs,
who was weakening noticeably now, failed at
a skin-tackle play, and it was fourth down with
six to go. Corson looked discouraged, and went
back to confer with Jones, while the panting St.
Matthew’s players gibed. Whatever it was that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Corson suggested Jones shook his head at. It
was the quarter himself who made the required
distance, running twenty yards across the field
to do it and only finding his opening at the last
moment, when Harry, forming his interference,
bowled over an opposing end.</p>

<p>Then the line-smashing began again. Past
the thirty yards went the Brown, past the
twenty-five, past the twenty. There were
three minutes left. Corson wanted to try a
field goal, but Jones again resisted. Harry
got through between left guard and tackle
and made three yards before he was smothered.
Belding redeemed himself by making
four outside of right tackle. Carstairs gained
a scant yard at center. With two to go on
the fourth down, the ball close to the ten-yard
line, Jones himself cut through for the
distance. They had to use the tape again, but
the verdict went to the Brown. Two minutes,
said the timekeeper. St. Matthew’s called for
time. A guard had his hand rebandaged and
a new fullback, primed with advice from the St.
Matthew’s coach, loped on. Then the teams
lined up again for the final effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>Carstairs was called on to get past left tackle,
but he was caught back of the line for a yard’s
loss. Then Jones noticed something. With the
advent of the new fullback the Blue was drawing
her line closer and the fullback and the two
halves were playing up behind it. Jones did
some quick thinking then. The ball was almost
on the ten-yard line, it was second down and
there was eleven to gain. And less than a
minute and a half of playing time remained.
He might hammer his way through as before
for a touchdown, he might try a field goal, he
might attempt a forward pass. Any of these
would be looked for by the enemy. Of the three
the forward pass promised to succeed best since
the Blue was playing her backfield up close to
the line. But there was one play that had not
been used during the game. It had been devised
for use around the middle of the field, but
Jones, scanning its possibilities, couldn’t see
why it should not do as well here under the
shadow of the goal. At least it had the merit
of unexpectedness, and the enemy’s present
formation on defense promised success. At all
events, he decided, he would try the line once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
more. So, calling for Third Formation, which
put both tackles at the left of the line and placed
the left halfback at the end of the rush line on
the right, the end falling in and back, he sent
Carstairs plunging at right tackle. The play
netted three yards. The timekeeper was slowly
walking nearer, watch in hand and eyes on the
dial. Then:</p>

<p>“Same formation!” called Jones. “37—39—164—28!”
A puzzled glance from Captain
Corson rewarded him, and Belding cried “Signals!”
in a panicky voice. Jones whispered to
him, shot a reassuring look at Corson and repeated:</p>

<p>“37—39—164—28! 37—39—164——”</p>

<p>Carstairs dropped back a good twelve yards
behind center, Jones stepped back mid-way between
him and the line and the ball shot to Carstairs.
As it settled into his hands he poised it
as though to throw it forward and to the left.
The St. Matthew’s line had concentrated on its
right, and now it struggled to break through,
while the backfield started around to intercept
the pass. The Blue’s left end plunged straight
across, dodging the opposing end, and made for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the fullback. Just as he leaped forward, however,
Carstairs sidestepped, passed the ball at
a quick toss to Jones, who had run back to take
it, and threw himself in front of the Blue’s end.
They went down together. Jones, the ball
tucked under his arm, wheeled across the field
for a dozen yards, and then, pausing suddenly,
raised the ball and sent it hurtling further out
to where, some fifteen feet from the side line,
Harry awaited it. Too late the St. Matthew’s
players saw the trick. Yards separated their
nearest player from <a href="#i_fp100">Harry</a> as the latter, <a href="#i_fp100">catching
the well-aimed pass coolly, romped unmolested
over the line</a> in three strides and, dodging
a blue-legged enemy, placed it fairly between
the posts!</p>

  <br />
  <div class="caption"><a href="#Page_100">“Harry ... catching the well-aimed pass coolly, romped

</div>

<p>Two minutes later, after Corson had attempted
the goal and failed and after the scoreboard
had changed its figures to 15 to 10, and
after the final whistle had shrilled, a delirious
mob took possession of Barnstead Field.
Brown flags snapped and waved, caps flew into
air and rained earthward and hundreds of
hoarse throats cheered and shouted. And
Harry, swaying rather dizzily about on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
shoulders of two enthusiastic admirers, following
the confused line that wound its way around
the gridiron, caught sight of a grinning face in
the throng beside him and waved a hand.</p>

<p>Perry Vose’s grin broadened.</p>

<p>“Who gave you the black eye, kid?” he
called.</p>

<p>“Oh, a friend of mine,” laughed Harry.
“Who spoiled your nose for you?”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine!” chuckled Perry. Then,
thrusting his way forward, “Here,” he said to
one of Harry’s bearers, “let me get there.
You’re too small for this job. Why, you’ve got
the biggest fellow in school there! Didn’t you
know that? Vamoose, I tell you!”</p>

<p>And the youth, looking doubtfully into
Perry’s grinning countenance, with its battered
nose and swollen lip, finally yielded his place.
It didn’t do to make Perry Vose angry!</p>

<p class="cap">“Willard!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris’s rebuke sounded
only half-hearted, and she shot an
apologetic glance at Willard’s father. But for
once Mr. Morris, the sternest of disciplinarians,
chose to be deaf. After all, the boy’s disappointment
was keen, and so his criticism of
Grandma Pierson elicited only the perfunctory
warning from his mother. The boy’s disappointment
was shared to a scarcely lesser extent
by his parents, but they had learned to bear
disappointment in silence. Willard, waiting for
his father’s reprimand, sat with downcast eyes
fixed on his untasted breakfast. Finally, however,
as the storm did not break, Willard took
courage and went on, but with more caution.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help it,” he insisted, with a
gulp. “She’d ought never to have promised if
she didn’t mean to keep it!”</p>

<p>“I’m certain, Will,” responded Mrs. Morris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
soothingly, “that your Grandma Pierson fully
meant to keep it. Mother was never the sort to
say a thing and not mean it.”</p>

<p>“If she hadn’t died, she’d have done just as
she said she’d do,” said Mr. Morris. “I guess
she expected to live a good many years yet.
Eighty-one isn’t very old; leastways, it wasn’t
for her; she was such an active old lady. When
were we out there before this time, mother?”</p>

<p>“Three years ago Christmas. That was when
she made the promise. I sort of wish she
hadn’t, seeing it’s turned out as it has.”</p>

<p>“She might have known she’d have to die
sometime,” said Willard rebelliously. “Seems
as though she might have made a new will after
she promised what she did.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she put it off, thinking there’d be
more money later,” replied Mr. Morris. “Cousin
Joe writes that the whole estate won’t
amount to much more than five thousand dollars;
and some of that’s in a mortgage that’ll
take a lot of handling to realize on. Fact is,
mother, I don’t just see where she expected to
get the money for Will, anyway, do you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Morris shook her head thoughtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
“Perhaps she thought that by the time Will was
ready for college she’d have the money. She
certainly meant to do something for him,
George. She’d always been especially fond of
Will.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she meant it, I’m sure. She asked me
how much it would take to see him through college,
and I told her two thousand. It was her
own idea. There wasn’t anything actually said
to that effect, mother, but I think it was sort of
understood that Will was to have that money
and that we weren’t to expect anything more.
And there wasn’t any reason why we should.
She’d have done quite enough for us if—if
she’d done that. As it is, Clara and Alice get
it all.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s my fault, George. You see,
I always wanted her to think we had—had
plenty. Mother was always pretty hard on
folks that couldn’t get along. And then Clara
and Alice both marrying men that couldn’t support
them——”</p>

<p>“I know. I’m glad you did. And I’m not begrudging
the money to your sisters. They need
it more’n we do, even if—— Anyway, we’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
always managed to get along pretty fair so
far, haven’t we? Maybe we haven’t had many
luxuries, Jenny, but we’ve managed, eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course we have. You and I don’t need
luxuries. I’ve always had everything I really
wanted, George. I’d have liked Will to go to
college, seeing he’s set his heart on it, but
maybe this is for the best, too. Maybe he will
be more help to you in the shop.”</p>

<p>Willard, staring distastefully at his plate,
frowned impatiently. “That’s fine, isn’t it?”
he demanded. “Here I’ve been telling all the
fellows that I was going to college in the fall;
and I’ve gone and taken the college course, too;
and Mr. Chase has been helping me with my
Greek! And now—now I can’t go after all! I
think it’s”—he gulped—“too bad!”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll get there, son, although I
don’t see much chance of it next fall. Maybe,
though, if business picks up——”</p>

<p>He stopped with a hopeless shake of his head.
Willard scowled.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard that before,” he muttered,
“about business picking up. It never has, and
I guess it never will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Son, you’ve said about enough,” replied his
father sternly. “If I can find the money to
send you to college, you’ll go. If I can’t, you’ll
have to buckle down at the shop. There’s
plenty of men doing well who never went to college.
I wanted you should go, but maybe it
wasn’t intended so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going, sir! When I get through
high school next Spring I’m going to find some
work and make enough money to start, anyway!
If I can make good on the football team this
year maybe I’ll get an offer and college won’t
cost me anything.”</p>

<p>“You let me hear of you doing anything like
that,” said Mr. Morris grimly, “and I’ll take
you out in the shed as I used to and just about
take the hide off you. You ain’t too big yet,
my boy!”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t do a thing like that, father. He
was just fooling, weren’t you, Will?”</p>

<p>“Lots of fellows do it,” muttered Willard.</p>

<p>“But you’re not to be one of them,” returned
his father decisively. “Here, let me see those
envelopes.”</p>

<p>Willard passed the packet across to him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
watched glumly while his father slid off the
faded blue ribbon that held the envelopes together.
One by one Mr. Morris held them up
and peered into them for the third or fourth
time.</p>

<p>“Unless she meant to put some money or a
check in one of these,” he murmured, “I can’t
understand it.” He laid the six envelopes in a
row on the cloth and shook his head over them.
Then he took up the papers which, with the
strange and disappointing legacy, had arrived
from the West by the morning’s mail, but they
told him nothing new. Grandmother Pierson’s
will, a copy of which Cousin Joe had sent, was
short and definite. There was a legacy of some
personal trinkets and a small sum of money to
an old family servant, and “To my grandson,
Willard Morris, the contents of the packet inscribed
with his name, which will be found in
the mahogany workbox on the table in my bedchamber.”
The rest of the estate, real and personal,
was bequeathed in equal shares to Mrs.
Morris’s two sisters. Cousin Joe’s letter was
brief. In pursuance of his duties as executor of
the estate, he was forwarding the legacy mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
in the will; also a copy of the instrument
in case they had forgotten its provisions.
Willard was to sign the accompanying
receipt; and Cousin Joe hoped they were all
well.</p>

<p>The package had been done up in a piece of
brown paper and tied with a white string—what
Grandma Pierson would have called “tie
yarn.” On the outside, in the old lady’s shaky
writing, was the legend, “For my Grandson,
Willard Morris.” Inside they had found six
envelopes which, once white, had yellowed with
age. The inscription on each was the same:
“Miss Ellen Hilliard, Fayle’s Court House,
Virginia,” and the postmarks showed various
dates in the years 1850 and 1851. In the upper
right-hand corner of each envelope was a stamp
quite unlike any Mr. Morris had ever seen.
Five were buff and one was blue. Each was
round and about the size of a silver half dollar.
They were printed in faded black. A circlet of
stars ran around the outer edge and inside was
the inscription, “Postoffice, Alexandria.” In
the center was the word “Paid,” and under it a
figure “5.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“You say these were your father’s love letters,
Jenny?” asked Mr. Morris.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have seen them many times. Mother
read me parts of them, too, sometimes. He
wrote beautifully, father did. Mother always
kept those letters in that old workbox with the
green velvet lining; the one the will speaks
about. It was her treasure box, and it was always
kept locked. I remember there were three
or four daguerreotypes there, and some clippings
from newspapers and such things.”</p>

<p>“She was careful to take the letters out,”
mused Mr. Morris.</p>

<p>“Maybe she had a feeling that she wouldn’t
get well. I suppose she destroyed the letters.
She wouldn’t want anyone reading them afterward,
you see, mother wouldn’t. Of course, it
might be that her mind wandered a little toward
the end and she thought she was really doing
something for Will when she put his name on
the package.”</p>

<p>“But Cousin Joe says the will was made almost
a year before she died,” objected Mr.
Morris. “I guess her mind was all right then.
Well, it’s plumb funny.” He arose from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
table with a sigh. “That’s what it is, plumb
funny.” He pulled out a big silver watch and
looked at it. “Son, I guess it’s time we were
hiking along.”</p>

<p>Willard pushed his chair back disconsolately
and arose. He was seventeen, rather tall for
his age, and had strong, broad shoulders like
his father’s, or as his father’s had been before
constant bending over desk and bench had
stooped them. The boy had a good-looking,
frank face and nice eyes, but just at present
the brown eyes were gloomy and the face expressed
discontent.</p>

<p>“Better take those envelopes before they get
lost, Will,” counseled his mother. He regarded
them with a scowl of contempt.</p>

<p>“I don’t want the old things,” he muttered
as he left the room. Mr. Morris, looking after
him, frowned and then sighed. Mrs. Morris
echoed the sigh.</p>

<p>“I guess this settles it, Jenny,” said Mr.
Morris, tucking the Audelsville <cite>Morning Times</cite>
in his pocket. “If I could get hold of the
money any way, he should have it, but I don’t
know where to turn for it, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind, dear,” said Mrs. Morris as her
husband stooped over her chair to kiss her.
“There’s almost a year yet and something may
turn up. You never can tell.”</p>

<p>“Well, might as well look on the bright side,
I suppose,” returned Mr. Morris, “although
things haven’t been turning up my way much
of late, Jenny.”</p>

<p>His gaze encountered the envelopes again,
and he stared at them a moment. Then, with
a puzzled shake of his head, he passed out.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">It was a fortnight later that Willard, returning
from practice with the high school
football team, and passing in front of Mrs.
Parson’s boarding-house, heard his name called
and looked up to see Mr. Chase at the open window
of his room.</p>

<p>“Come up and pay me a visit, Will,” said the
Assistant Principal.</p>

<p>Willard hesitated a moment. He had been
rather avoiding Mr. Chase for the last two
weeks. Now, however, he waved his hand and,
turning in at the gate, entered the house and
climbed the stairs to the teacher’s room. Mr.
Chase was seated at a small table by the window.</p>

<p>“Pardon me if I don’t get up, Will,” he said.
“I’ve only got two more of these things to
paste, and I want to get them in before the light
goes. Well, how are you getting on at football?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“Pretty fair, sir.”</p>

<p>“Find it more interesting than our old friend
Homer, eh? You know we haven’t had a Greek
lesson for a long time, Will.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, and I—I guess there isn’t any use
having any more.”</p>

<p>“Why, how’s that? Think you know enough
to get by those exams, do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to take them, sir. I—I’m not
going to college, after all.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase looked up in surprise. “Not going!”
he exclaimed. “Why, Will, I thought
that was all settled. What’s changed your
mind?”</p>

<p>Willard very nearly replied that Grandma
Pierson had changed his mind, but he didn’t.
Instead, “Father can’t afford it, sir,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear, I’m sorry! Is it—quite settled?
Isn’t there any hope, Will?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t think so. Not unless I earn
the money somehow, and I guess I couldn’t do
that!”</p>

<p>“It would take some time,” Mr. Chase agreed
dubiously. “You’d need pretty nearly three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
hundred a year, Will, although you might
scale that down a little. I’m sorry, awfully
sorry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, so’m I.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Mr.
Chase asked: “And you don’t think you want
to go on with the Greek, eh? Suppose you
found next Fall that you could go after all, my
boy. You’d have hard work passing, I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s any hope of it,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Still, the unexpected sometimes happens,
doesn’t it? You wouldn’t want to lose your
chance for the want of a little Greek, now,
would you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but——”</p>

<p>“Then don’t you think we’d better go on
with our Friday evenings, Will? I do. Even
if you shouldn’t get to college, my boy, a working
knowledge of Greek isn’t going to be a bad
thing to have. Now suppose you drop in on
Friday after supper?”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir, I guess I might as well. I—I
haven’t studied much lately, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Better look it over a bit before Friday then.
There, that’s done! Now we’ll light up and
have a chat.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you collected stamps, Mr.
Chase,” said Willard as the teacher closed the
window and lighted the study lamp on the big
table.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I ever shown you my books?”
asked Mr. Chase. “Yes, I’m a ‘stamp fiend,’
Will. It’s not a bad hobby. Expensive, though.
I couldn’t afford it if I was married. I suppose,”
he added ruefully, “I oughtn’t to afford
it now.”</p>

<p>“I started to collect stamps when I was a
little kid,” confided Willard as he took the chair
Mr. Chase pushed forward, “but I didn’t get
very far. I don’t know what ever became of my
stamps. I guess they’re in the attic, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes? Did you have many?” asked Mr.
Chase as he washed the mucilage from his fingers
at the stand.</p>

<p>“Only about a hundred, I guess. I had a
Cape of Good Hope, though.”</p>

<p>“Did you?” Mr. Chase inquired. “Which
one was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t remember. Is there more than
one!”</p>

<p>“Quite a few,” Mr. Chase laughed. “And
they differ considerably in value. You must
show me your collection sometime.”</p>

<p>“I guess it isn’t worth showing,” murmured
Willard. “I guess all my stamps are just common
ones. There was one, though, I paid a dollar
for. I forget what it was. I suppose you
have an awful lot?”</p>

<p>“About twelve hundred only, I believe, but
some of them are rather good. When I stop
to consider what those stamps have cost me,
though, I have to shudder. Still, stamps—rare
ones, I mean, aren’t a bad investment. You
know the good ones increase in value right
along.”</p>

<p>“Twelve hundred!” exclaimed Willard.
“Why, I didn’t know there were so many
stamps in the world!”</p>

<p>“There are a good many more than twelve
hundred,” replied the teacher with a smile.
“And I don’t go in for ‘freaks’ much, either;
nor revenues. Revenues in themselves would
keep a man busy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by freaks?” asked Willard.</p>

<p>“Oh, ‘splits’ and ‘blanks’ and surcharges
and such. Of course, though, I have a few surcharges.”</p>

<p>“And what is a split, Mr. Chase?”</p>

<p>“A split is a stamp of, say, two-cent denomination
cut diagonally across. Each half equals
in value a one-cent stamp. Some time ago when
an office ran out of one-cent stamps it would
cut up a lot of twos. Sometimes a ten-cent
stamp was split to make two fives, and in one
case three-cent stamps were cut in such a way
that two-thirds of them did duty for a two-cent
stamp. Later, when the government ran out of
a certain issue they merely took a stamp of a
lower denomination and surcharged it, that is,
printed over it the larger denomination. I
have a friend who makes a specialty of provisional
stamps, such as ‘splits’ and ‘postmasters.’
He pays no attention to anything else,
and has two full books already, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Some stamps cost a lot, don’t they?” Willard
asked.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, a good many of them do,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Mr. Chase chuckled. “There’s a rumor that
someone paid seventeen thousand dollars not so
long ago for a pair of Mauritius postoffice
stamps, one-penny and two-penny. Those are
mighty rare and I’ve never seen them. Then
there’s the British Guiana one-cent and the
Niger Coast Protectorate; one of the latter—I
forget its list number—is perhaps the rarest
stamp in the world, since only one of its kind
was ever printed.”</p>

<p>“My!” said Willard. “That must be worth
a lot!”</p>

<p>“So much that it’s never had a price put on
it, I guess. Some of our own stamps are worth
quite a lot, too. Take some of the Postmasters’
Provisionals, for instance. Only one copy is
known of an issue from Boscawen, New Hampshire,
and whoever has that surely has a prize.”</p>

<p>“What is a Postmasters’ Pro—what you
said?”</p>

<p>“Provisional?” laughed Mr. Chase. “I’ll
show you.” He reached under the table and
pulled out a big square album, and Willard
moved his chair nearer. “Provisional stamps
were made and issued by postmasters in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
days before we had a national postage stamp
system. Here’s one issued in Trenton, New
Jersey, and here’s one from Portland, Maine.
See? Some of them are pretty simple; just the
name of the office and the words ‘Paid—5.’
They’re interesting, though, and, as I say, some
of them bring a lot of money.”</p>

<p>“How—how much did those cost?” asked
Willard eagerly.</p>

<p>“These? Oh, not much. This one was
twelve and—let me see—that was eight, I
think, and——”</p>

<p>“Eight cents!”</p>

<p>“Hardly! Eight dollars, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Well—well, if they came from some other
place would they be worth that much?” stammered
Willard.</p>

<p>“Depends on how many there are; how rare
they happen to be. It’s scarcity that fixes the
prices on stamps—and most other things.”</p>

<p>“Supposing they were from Alexandria, Virginia,”
Willard pursued rather breathlessly.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase closed the book and replaced it
under the table.</p>

<p>“If they came from Alexandria and were genuine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
they’d be worth quite as much as these,
perhaps more. Why do you ask? You don’t
happen to have one in your collection, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! That is, not in my collection, but
I’ve got some that—that my grandmother sent
me.”</p>

<p>“What! Postmaster Provisionals of Alexandria,
Virginia? Are you certain? What are
they like? What are they?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase was plainly interested.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether they’re Postmaster
Provisionals,” replied Willard, “but they’re a
good deal like those in your book. They’re
round and sort of yellowish-brown——”</p>

<p>“Yes, buff; go on!”</p>

<p>“And they have some stars around the edge
and the name and ‘Paid—5’ in the middle, just
like those of yours.”</p>

<p>“You say your grandmother gave them to
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” And thereupon Willard told
about the legacy and Mr. Chase learned the real
reason why the college career had been abandoned.
And when he had finished Mr. Chase
strode to a bookshelf and returned with a catalogue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
After some excited turning of pages he
paused and read silently. “That’s right,” he
said finally. “Your description tallies with
Scott’s. Where are those envelopes, Will?
Can you let me see them?”</p>

<p>“I guess they’re at home. I haven’t seen
them since that day. I—I hope mother didn’t
throw them away!”</p>

<p>“Throw them away!” Mr. Chase slammed
the book shut, tossed it aside and seized Willard’s
cap from the couch. “Put this on,” he
exclaimed, “and scoot home! Find those envelopes
and bring them over here! If your
mother <em>has</em> thrown them away you’re out sixty
or seventy dollars at least!”</p>

<p>“Where are those envelopes, mother?” asked
Willard five minutes later, bursting into the
kitchen where Mrs. Morris was in the act of
sliding a pan of hot biscuits from the oven. The
pan almost fell to the floor and Mrs. Morris
straightened up to remonstrate against
“scaring a body to death,” but the words died
away when she saw Willard’s face.</p>

<p>“What envelopes do you mean, Will?” she
gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“The ones Grandma Pierson sent! Mr.
Chase says those stamps may be worth seventy
dollars!”</p>

<p>“Sakes alive, Willard Morris! You don’t
mean it? Why—why—what did I do with
them? Haven’t you seen them around?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t seen them since the day they
came. Don’t you know what you did with them,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Why—why,” faltered Mrs. Morris, “it
doesn’t seem as if I did anything with them,
Will! I don’t recollect seeing them after you
and your father went off. Will, you don’t suppose”—her
voice became scarcely more than a
whisper—“you don’t suppose I threw them
away, do you?”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be likely to, would you?” he
asked anxiously. “Won’t you please try and
think?”</p>

<p>“I am trying, Will, but—but I can’t remember
seeing them again.” She hurried to the
dining-room, which was also the sitting-room,
and began a feverish search. Willard followed
behind her and looked wherever she did, and
in two minutes the room had the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
of having been devastated by a cyclone. And in
the midst of the confusion Mr. Morris entered.
Being excitedly informed of what was going
on, he, too, took a hand in the hunt. But ten
minutes later they all had to acknowledge that
the envelopes were not in the room.</p>

<p>“I don’t see what I could have done with
them,” reiterated Willard’s mother for the
twentieth time.</p>

<p>“Maybe you shook ’em out the door when
you shook the cloth,” suggested Mr. Morris.
And his wife had to own that such a thing was
quite possible, adding, however, “Only I’d been
almost certain to have seen them when I cleared
the dishes off. Are you sure you didn’t take
them, Will?”</p>

<p>“I know he didn’t,” said Mr. Morris. “I
remember seeing them lying right here when I
left the room.”</p>

<p>“Well, then I did something with them, that’s
certain,” murmured Mrs. Morris, looking
dazedly about, “but I don’t see what!”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better have supper,” said Willard’s
father. “We can have another look afterward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>So Mrs. Morris returned to her duties, while
Willard, preparing hastily for the meal, returned
to the room and continued the search.
At the table he ate very little, and as soon as
supper was over he began rummaging again.
The search ultimately led from the dining-room
to the parlor, from the parlor to the kitchen,
from the kitchen to the hall closet and from
there to the bedrooms upstairs. And at eight
o’clock Mrs. Morris, lamp in hand, was peering
about in the attic! At half past eight Willard
went to the telephone and, calling Mr.
Chase up, acknowledged defeat.</p>

<p>“You can’t find them?” came the teacher’s
voice. “That’s too bad. Are you—er—are you
quite sure you had them, Will?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am,” replied Willard a trifle
shortly. “If you don’t believe me you can ask
father.”</p>

<p>“Have you looked in the waste baskets and
the ash can and—and those places?”</p>

<p>“We’ve looked everywhere. I guess what
happened was that my mother shook the tablecloth
at the back door and they were in it and
fell out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’d have another look to-morrow by
daylight,” advised Mr. Chase in disappointed
tones. “Don’t give up yet, Will. You may
find them tucked away where you least expect
to. I’m awfully sorry. Good-night.”</p>

<p>Willard hung up the receiver. “Of course he
doesn’t care,” he muttered resentfully. “Gee,
if I could find those envelopes and get seventy
dollars for the stamps, I’d have to earn only
about a hundred and eighty to have enough for
the first year. He says it’ll take ’most three
hundred, but I’m sure I could do it on two hundred
and fifty. And if I could get through the
first year they’d have a whole lot of trouble
keeping me away the second!”</p>

<p>In the morning, after a sleep badly disturbed
by dreams, Willard was up early and, after the
kitchen fire was started, was out in the back
yard searching around the kitchen doorway,
amongst the currant bushes and along the
picket fence. But he found no trace of the envelopes.
That was Tuesday and hope didn’t
actually fail him until Thursday. On that day
Mr. Morris put his foot down.</p>

<p>“They’re gone for good, mother, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
isn’t any use fretting about ’em. So you just
stop pulling the house to pieces and settle down
again. When a thing’s so, it’s so, and you can’t
make it any other way, no matter how much
you worry about it. You haven’t taken time
to eat a decent meal since the pesky things were
lost. Now I say let ’em go and have an end
of it!”</p>

<p>That evening Willard found his old stamp
book in the attic and took it over to Mr. Chase.
But although the latter went through it carefully,
he found no prizes there. The entire contents
wouldn’t have brought a dollar at a stamp
dealer’s. When he was leaving Mr. Chase reminded
him that they were to begin the Greek
lessons again the next evening. Willard hesitated
and then promised half-heartedly to
come. What was the good of knowing Greek if
he couldn’t get to college?</p>

<p>But at seventeen no disappointment is big
enough to last forever, and Friday was a wonderful
Autumn day with just the right amount
of tingle in the air, and at football practice
Willard played so well that the coach promised
to let him start the game against Shrevesport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
High the next afternoon, and—well, after a
good supper eaten with a healthy appetite, Willard
had quite forgotten about Grandma Pierson’s
legacy! And at half past seven he found
his Iliad—it wasn’t an easy task, either, because
since the search for the lost envelopes
scarcely anything was where it used to be!—and
set out for Mrs. Parson’s with a light heart.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have a chance to study this any,”
said Willard as he seated himself across the
table from Mr. Chase. “I’ve been too busy
looking for those envelopes, you see. So you’ll
have to excuse me if it comes slow.”</p>

<p>“All right, Will, I’ll forgive you this time.
Do you remember where we left off? Wasn’t it
where Ulysses and Diomede are setting out to
spy on the enemy’s camp?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we were way past that. I’ve got
the place marked. I think——”</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s wrong?” exclaimed Mr.
Chase.</p>

<p>“Why—why—here they are! They were in
this book!”</p>

<p>“Eh? What were in——”</p>

<p>“Those envelopes, sir! Look!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>And there they were, sure enough; all together
and with the bit of faded blue ribbon
about them! Mr. Chase, beaming, held out his
hand for them. Willard, still exclaiming,
hazarding theories as to how they got into his
Iliad, followed around the table while Mr. Chase
carefully slid off the band of ribbon and looked
them over.</p>

<p>“‘Alexandria,’” he muttered, “‘Paid—5,’
They’re the real thing, Will! By Jove, what
a find! Perfect condition, too! Not a tear on
one of them! And no—<em>hello, what’s this</em>?”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” asked Willard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase was staring at the last envelope
as though he couldn’t believe his eyes. “Why—why,
it’s <em>blue</em>!” he almost shouted.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I—I forgot that one was blue.
There were five of them brown and one blue.
Isn’t—isn’t it any good?”</p>

<p>“Any good!” exclaimed Mr. Chase. “Any
good? It—it’s——”</p>

<p>Over went his chair and he had seized the
catalogue from the shelf. “Any good!” he
muttered as he turned the pages quickly. “Any
good! Any——” His voice died out and Willard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
wondering, watched his lips move as he
read silently. Then the teacher studied the envelope
again. “‘Ditto,’ he murmured, ‘on
blue.’” Then he closed the catalogue slowly
and decisively and laid it on the table. Willard
watched him fascinatedly. He had never
seen Mr. Chase look so excited, so wild-eyed as
this! Was it possible that the Assistant Principal
had suddenly lost his mind?</p>

<p>“Will,” said Mr. Chase slowly and solemnly,
“I—I can’t be sure—I’m afraid to be sure—but
if this stamp is genuine it’s worth——”
He stopped and shook his head. When he continued
it was to himself rather than to Willard.
“There may be a mistake. Perhaps the catalogue’s
wrong. We’ll wait and see.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean,” asked Willard eagerly,
“that the blue one is worth more than the
others?”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase laid the envelope on the table and
was silent a moment. When he answered he
was quite himself again.</p>

<p>“It looks so, Will. Yes, I think I may safely
say that the blue stamp is worth quite a little
money. You see, there are two or three dozen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of the buff ones known of, but so far only one
or two blues have ever shown up. But I may
be mistaken; don’t get your hopes up until
we’ve had it examined, my boy.”</p>

<p>“How much is it worth if—if it is—what you
think?” asked Willard.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase shook his head. “Let’s not talk
about that now. I—there’s the possibility that
I may be mistaken. Will you let me have these
for a week or so? I’d like to send them to the
city and get expert advice.”</p>

<p>“Of course. You do anything you like with
them, sir. Only if you care for it I’d like you
to have one of them, Mr. Chase.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice of you, Will, but I couldn’t take
one as a gift. I’ll gladly buy one if I can afford
it. Or—wait a bit! If this blue one is
worth what I think it is, I’ll accept one of the
buff stamps as a present. How will that do?”</p>

<p>“I’d like you to have one anyhow, sir. Do
you think the blue stamp is worth—worth a
hundred dollars?” asked Willard.</p>

<p>“Will, I don’t dare to say. Yes, perhaps a
hundred; perhaps more, much more—unless
I’m making a bad mistake somehow. I’ll mail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
these to-morrow and we ought to hear inside a
week. Now—now let’s get back to the lesson.”</p>

<p>But Willard didn’t make much progress that
evening.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">Of course Mrs. Morris remembered when
Willard told her.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it funny?” she asked beamingly.
“It all comes back to me now. When I
went to clear off the table those envelopes were
there and I thought to myself, ‘Those are Will’s
and he may want them after all, and I’ll just
tuck them in his Greek book.’ It was lying on
the side table there. And then I forgot all
about it! I’m so sorry, Will!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter a bit now,” Willard declared.
“How much do you suppose that blue
stamp will be worth, mother?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Morris shook her head. “Goodness
knows, Will! But maybe it’ll bring enough to
buy you a nice suit of clothes and——”</p>

<p>“Clothes!” scoffed Willard. “That money
is going to put me in college. If there isn’t
enough of it I’ll get a job somewhere next summer
and earn the difference. I heard of a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
who made nearly three hundred dollars one
summer just selling books!”</p>

<p>“It’s my opinion,” declared Mr. Morris,
“that that stamp is worth a whole lot of money
and that your grandma knew it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how she could, sir,” Willard
objected. “Why, even Mr. Chase isn’t certain
about it yet.”</p>

<p>“Mother was a great one to read the papers,”
said Mrs. Morris, “and I wouldn’t be
surprised if she saw sometime that stamps like
that were valuable. She was forever cutting
things out of newspapers and saving them.”</p>

<p>“We’ll wait and see,” said Mr. Morris.
“You’ll find I’m right, son. And if I am I’ll be
mighty pleased!”</p>

<p>Waiting, though, was hard work for Willard.
For a week he managed to be fairly patient,
but at the end of that period he began to be uneasy.
“You don’t think they got lost in the
mail, do you?” he asked Mr. Chase.</p>

<p>“They couldn’t because I didn’t send them
by mail. I was afraid to. I sent them by express
and put—well, a good big valuation on
them. So, even if they should be lost, Will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
you’ll have a lot of money coming to you from
the express company.”</p>

<p>That was comforting, anyhow, and there
were times when Willard hoped devoutly that
the express company had mislaid the package.
But it hadn’t. Four days later Willard was
called to the telephone at suppertime.</p>

<p>“Will, can you come over here after supper?”
It was Mr. Chase’s voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Have you heard——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got a letter. You come over——”</p>

<p>“Is it all right, sir? About the blue stamp,
I mean.”</p>

<p>“Hm; well, you come over and I’ll tell you.”
Something that sounded like a chuckle reached
Willard. “Good-by!”</p>

<p>“I’m going over to Mr. Chase’s,” he announced.
“He’s heard about the stamp. I
don’t want any more supper!”</p>

<p>“What about it, Will?” his father asked
eagerly. “How much’s it worth?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. He wouldn’t tell me.
Where’s my cap? Anyone seen—— Here it
is! I’ll come back right away—if it’s all
right!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Will!” greeted Mr. Chase. “Nice
evening, isn’t it?” There was a perceptible
twinkle in his eye and Willard grinned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s a fine evening,” he answered
with a gulp.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re having wonderful weather for
the time of year. I got a reply from that fellow
in New York. What did I do with it?”
Mr. Chase pretended to have mislaid it and
dipped into one pocket after another. Willard
squirmed in his chair. “Ah, here it is,” said
the teacher finally, drawing the letter from his
inside pocket. “Now, let’s see.” He opened
it with tantalizing deliberation. “I asked him
to examine those envelopes and give me an estimate
of their value. I didn’t tell him we had
four more of them, by the way.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” murmured Willard.</p>

<p>“Well, he says he will buy the buff one
for twelve dollars. That’s less than I hoped
to get for them and maybe we might do a little
better somewhere else. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; I mean—I don’t know!” blurted
Willard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“Now in regard to the blue one——” Mr.
Chase paused and looked across at the boy.
What he saw seemed to please him, for he
smiled. “I’ll read you what Watkins says
about the blue one, Will. Let—me—see; here
we are! ‘Of course you know you’ve got the
prize of the year in the “black-on-blue.” I’ll
take it off your hands if you want me to, but
you’d probably do better at auction. The stamp
is in perfect condition and, being on the original
envelope, ought to fetch top price. There’s
a big auction in December and you’d better let
me list it for that if you want to sell it. Your
letter doesn’t state whether you do or don’t.
I’m keeping the stamps until I hear further.
The last Alexandria Postmaster black-on-blue
sold two years ago in this city to John Thayer
Williams of Philadelphia. It was without envelope
and slightly soiled. The price paid was
twenty-six hundred. Your stamp ought to
bring a couple of hundred more at least. Awaiting
your instructions, respectfully yours, W.
L. Watkins.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Chase folded the letter and smiled across
at the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that, Will?” he
asked.</p>

<p>Willard returned the smile rather tremulously.</p>

<p>“I think,” he began. Then he stopped,
cleared his throat and began over again. “I
think,” he said huskily, “that Grandma Pierson
is going to send me to college after all,
just as she promised!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., sauntered
along the aisle, his trim young
body accommodating itself gracefully
to the erratic swaying of the day coach. I
speak of Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., as being
trim, but you are not to picture him as slender.
On the contrary, without being fat, he had in
his fourteen years and some months of existence
managed to cushion his frame with enough
flesh to give him a comfortably well-rounded
appearance. It seemed probable that later on
the cushion would increase in depth and that
the term trim would no longer be applicable.
In fact, Daniel Webster Jones’s father—you
saw his likeness on the cartoons holding his
justly celebrated Creamette Biscuits—was quite
abundantly upholstered. But at present, what
with an easy and graceful carriage and a careful
attention to the niceties of attire, Daniel
Webster Jones, Jr., presented a most pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
appearance. Under a straw hat which was absolutely
the latest cry in masculine fashions,
the boy’s copper-brown hair was brushed
sleekly back from a well-shaped forehead.
Grayish blue eyes, a nose rather too button-like
to be called classical, a cherubic mouth, a
nice, firm chin with a dimple in it, all these features
set in a round, healthy, rosy-cheeked face
combined to make Daniel Webster Jones, Jr.,
thoroughly attractive. Yet it was, I think, the
qualities of mind and character illumining the
ingenuous countenance that won folks to him.
The gray-blue eyes seemed veritable pools of
truthfulness, the button-like nose proclaimed
uncompromising integrity, the cherub lips appeared
formed for the utterance of pure and
beautiful thoughts, and when Daniel Webster
Jones, Jr., smiled, one felt oh, so glad that such
innocence and candor existed in a deceitful
world!</p>

<p>The boy’s progress through the car was
neither unnoticed nor unheralded. Small and
admiring juniors looked appealingly upward
and sought recognition with a wistful “How
d’ye do, Jones,” while upper-class fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
rousing from the lethargy induced by a two-hour
journey on a hot September afternoon, observed
his advent with something of the same
relief with which a traveler on the desert might
catch sight of an oasis and hailed him hopefully
with a “Hi, Jonesie!” But Daniel Webster
Jones, Jr., merely nodded with just the
correct amount of superciliousness to the juniors—one
had to keep the kids in their place—and
returned the greetings of the others with
preoccupied gravity. Oddly enough this had
the effect of causing smirks and winks and
nudges amongst the older fellows and one felt
glad that Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., was unconscious
of the levity. One felt certain that
it would have wounded him.</p>

<p>The car was filled almost to its capacity, yet
here and there a seat held but one occupant.
At such a seat, near the front of the coach,
Jonesie—for after all why should we accord
him the dignity of his full title when no one
else did?—Jonesie, then, paused indecisively
and caught the shy upward glance of the seat’s
only occupant, a boy of perhaps thirteen years
of age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>“Mind if I sit here?” asked Jonesie most politely.
“Sorry to bother you, but everything’s
pretty well filled up.”</p>

<p>“Not—not at all!” stammered the other
boy. He tugged frantically at a fat suitcase
bearing the inscription “J. A. W.” on the end
and squeezed toward the window. Jonesie murmured
his thanks and seated himself with a
sigh, folding his arms and staring ahead of
him with a thoughtful frown. The train swayed
onward in a cloud of gray dust. After a moment
the original occupant of the seat took courage
and studied his neighbor out of the corners
of his eyes. He liked what he saw and
wondered sympathetically what weighty care
was clouding the brow under the stunning
straw. At that moment Jonesie unclasped his
arms and began to study a purple blister at the
base of the second finger on his right palm. The
other boy, interested, looked, too. It was a
most promising blister. He speculated as to the
cause of it and considered its future treatment
rather enviously. And at that moment the
proud possessor of the blister looked up and
caught his glance embarrassingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>“Played thirty-six holes yesterday,” said
Jonesie. “Hadn’t golfed before all summer.”
He frowned at the blister, wiggling his finger
experimentally. “Beastly bother,” he added
disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed the other, almost with enthusiasm.
The sympathy seemed to draw Jonesie’s
attention to his companion for the first
time and he turned and shot a brief and speculative
glance at him. Then,</p>

<p>“Randall’s?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, I—I’m just entering.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Jonesie beamed with a sudden
friendly interest. “That’s fine. Lower Middle,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“N-no, just Junior,” returned the other apologetically.</p>

<p>Jonesie nodded. “Should have thought you’d
enter Lower Middle. You look it.” The new
boy flushed with pleasure at the implied tribute
to his age, wisdom and experience. “I’m in
the Lower Middle myself,” continued Jonesie,
crossing one smartly clad leg over the other
and assuming an attitude promising confidential
discourse. “Hope you will like the school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“I—I think so, thank you,” murmured the
other. “I don’t know much about boarding
schools, though. I suppose it will be—be sort
of strange at first.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” replied Jonesie sympathetically.
“Of course a new boy has quite a lot
to learn, but you’ll get on to things after a bit.
It isn’t a bad school, Randall’s. I dare say you
know some of the fellows?”</p>

<p>“No.” The other shook his head a trifle dejectedly.
“I guess I don’t know a soul there.”</p>

<p>Jonesie frowned. “That makes it harder,”
he acknowledged. “But you’ll find friends after
a bit,” he added hopefully. “Sooner the better,
too, for there’s nothing like having an older
fellow to—er—sort of give you a hand over the
rough places.” Jonesie regulated carefully the
expanse of violet and gray cuff showing beyond
his coat sleeve. “At least, that was my
experience. Take the matter of athletics, for
instance—— But perhaps you don’t go in for
that sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” replied the other eagerly, “that
is, I hope to. I—I’m very fond of football.”</p>

<p>“Fine game, football,” commended Jonesie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
“And that’s a—er—a case in point. Of course
you’ll want to make the School Team; every
fellow does.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t expect to do that! Not the—the
first year!”</p>

<p>“Why not? Fellows have done it. Don’t
know why you shouldn’t if you buckle down to
it. I dare say I had a close shave from getting
on the School myself the first year. Unfortunately
illness—er”—Jonesie’s gaze wandered
along the bell rope—“illness prevented. Quite
a blow to the Coach.”</p>

<p>“You—you are on the Team now?” asked
the other eagerly.</p>

<p>Jonesie shook his head regretfully. “No, I
never got into football after that. Doctor’s orders.
Perhaps next year—I’m so much better——”
He sighed and then smiled brightly,
bravely. “Well, it doesn’t matter, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but if you’re really fond of the game,”
exclaimed the other boy feelingly, “it must be—be
an awful disappointment! I—I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Yes, of course it <em>is</em> a disappointment,
but”—Jonesie shrugged his shoulders—“life
is full of disappointments and one soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
learns to—er—accept them philosophically.
Now take your case—er—— You didn’t tell
me your name, did you?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s Wigman.”</p>

<p>“Mine’s Jones, D. W. Jones. Well, as I was
saying, Wigman, take your case. You may have
to—to accept disappointment, too. You see,
there’ll be piles of fellows trying for the Team,
and some of them may show up as well as you
will, although I will say”—and here Jonesie
turned to scrutinize Wigman carefully and approvingly—“that
from your looks you ought to
have the making of a dandy player.” Wigman
flushed under the compliment. “But there you
are! Merit isn’t everything. You might play
as well as another chap and yet he’d get the
call just because he had—er—friends to speak
for him. Do you see?”</p>

<p>“But—but that’s hardly fair, is it?” asked
Wigman. “I thought Randall’s was a school
where you—where every fellow had the same
chance as every other fellow. I—I’ve heard
so.”</p>

<p>“Sure! That’s so, to a certain extent. Still,
you know yourself, Wigman, that if you were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
captain of the Team—as you will be some day,
or I miss my guess!—you couldn’t help favoring
the fellow you knew, supposing he played
as well as the other fellow, whom you didn’t
know. It’s human nature, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Wigman allowed that it was.</p>

<p>“Of course! There you are, then! So what
you want to do is to make friends, Wigman;
get acquainted right away and, if you can do
it, find a fellow who’s close to Bing.”</p>

<p>“Bing?” faltered Wigman.</p>

<p>“Yes, Carey Bingham. He’s captain this
year. His chums call him Bing for short. Nice
chap, Bing. I’ve just been having a chat with
him in the smoker. Bing has a queer idea that
I’m a judge of football material. Maybe he
isn’t so far wrong, either; I’ve picked more
than one green player and seen him develop
into a wonder. And I don’t believe I’ve picked
a bad ’un yet. We were talking over this year’s
prospects. Bing’s inclined to be a bit discouraged
and—er—pessimistic, but I told him that
to my mind we had as good an outlook as ever
we’d had. Quite cheered up, he was, when I
left him. Wanted me to stay and go over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
schedule with him, but I couldn’t stand the
smoke any longer. Well, here’s the bridge.
We’ll be at Chester Hill in five minutes. I
must get my things together. Awfully glad
to have met you, Wigman, and if there’s anything
I can do for you just let me know, will
you?”</p>

<p>“Th—thank you,” said the other boy gratefully.
“But I wouldn’t think of bothering
you.”</p>

<p>“No bother at all. Tell you what I’ll do, Wigman.”
Jonesie drew forth a silver card case,
abstracted an oblong slip of thin cardboard
bearing his name and home address in ornate
Old English letters and scrawled a line on it
with a silver pencil. “There’s where I hang
out—18 Hawthorne. Look me up as soon as
you get settled or let me know where to find
you and I’ll drop in. Maybe I can put you on to
the ropes a bit, eh? Very glad to do anything I
can for a new fellow. Know what it means to
be dumped down here with a couple of hundred
strangers. Makes you feel sort of lost and all
that for a bit. I know! Glad to have met you,
Wigman. See you again soon, I hope.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>Jonesie smiled his best and sweetest smile,
shook hands and sauntered off, leaving James
Andrew Wigman filled with gratitude and admiration.
Halfway along the aisle an imperious
hand shot out and seized on Jonesie.
Jonesie, after a vain attempt to elude his captor,
faced him innocently.</p>

<p>“Hello, Carpenter,” he said sweetly.
“How’s the boy?”</p>

<p>“What have you been up to, Jonesie?” inquired
Carpenter, a big Senior, sternly.</p>

<p>“Me?” Jonesie’s candid countenance expressed
surprise. “Why, nothing!”</p>

<p>“What kind of a yarn have you been stringing
to that poor Fresh down there?” persisted
Carpenter.</p>

<p>“You make me tired! Can’t a fellow be decent
to a new boy, I’d like to know? I’ve been
cheering him up a bit, that’s all. Found him
terribly down in the dumps, poor chap. You
Upper Class fellows never think of trying to
make things a bit easier for new boys.” Jonesie
mingled regret with indignation. Carpenter
blinked. “Seems to me you fellows ought to remember
how you felt yourselves when you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
struck school and didn’t know anyone! It—it’s
mighty lonesome business, Carpenter!”</p>

<p>“Is that so, Jonesie? Well, you’d better
write to the <cite>Weekly</cite> about it. A fat lot of comforting
you were doing, I’ll bet!” But after
Jonesie had gone on, Carpenter glanced inquiringly
at Gus Peasley, who occupied the seat
with him. “Maybe Jonesie is right about it,
too,” said Carpenter. “I dare say it would be
a decent thing if some of us Upper Classmen
sort of looked after the new boys a little. I
remember myself——”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” This was Peasley, grinning.
“Jonesie doesn’t care a hang whether a new
boy is homesick! Bet you a dollar, Billy, he’s
been up to some more of his deviltry!”</p>

<p>“Think so?” asked Carpenter doubtfully.
“Maybe. I wouldn’t trust him. Just the same,
Gus, there’s something in what he said.”</p>

<p>Peasley yawned as he got up to rescue his
suitcase from the rack above.</p>

<p>“Jonesie could talk tears out of a brick,
Billy,” he replied. “He’s the biggest little
faker in school. Some day, if he doesn’t get
hung first, he’ll be President!”</p>

<p class="cap">The Fall Term was three days old when
James Andrew Wigman availed himself
of Jonesie’s invitation. Jonesie
returned to his room that afternoon in a condition
of utter boredom. It had rained all day,
there was no promise of clearing, and Jonesie,
unfortunately susceptible to weather conditions,
was as near having a case of the blues as
is possible for a healthy boy of fourteen. After
slamming the door and skimming his wet cap
across the study in the general direction of the
window seat he thrust his hands into his trousers
pockets and stared disgustedly at his roommate.
“Sparrow” Bowles, deep in the pages of
a paper-covered romance, never even turned his
head. Sparrow was fifteen, long, lank, dark-complexioned
and lazy. Fate had thrown them
together at the commencement of their Junior
Year and Jonesie had never yet quite forgiven
Fate. Finally, discovering that his scowling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
regard was having no impression, he observed
challengingly:</p>

<p>“Crazy old bookworm!”</p>

<p>Sparrow looked up and blinked.</p>

<p>“What’s eating you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Jonesie grunted and sank into a chair. “Find
out,” he said affably. Sparrow shrugged his
narrow shoulders and turned back to his book.
Jonesie continued to glower upon him. At
length:</p>

<p>“You’ll turn into a book some day,” he
sneered.</p>

<p>“You’ll turn into a jug of vinegar some
day,” replied the other, without looking up.
But the cleverness of the retort brought a
smirk to his face. Seeing it, Jonesie reached
a foot forward and dexterously sent the paper-covered
volume hurtling across the room.</p>

<p>“Fresh!” he muttered.</p>

<p>Sparrow viewed him angrily through the
round lenses of his rubber-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>“You pick that up!” he demanded.</p>

<p>Jonesie smiled cheerfully. “Yes, I will!” he
responded. But the tone of voice rather contradicted
the statement. Sparrow glared indecisively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
from his companion to the book.
Sparrow was not afraid of Jonesie, but he
was far too lazy to engage in combat unless
absolutely driven to it. Finally, with a
shrug:</p>

<p>“It’ll stay there, then,” he said.</p>

<p>“For all of me,” agreed Jonesie.</p>

<p>Followed a silence. Sparrow blinked at the
falling rain and the dripping trees on the
campus. Jonesie gazed speculatively at Sparrow.
But the scrap, as brief as it had been,
had in a measure relieved his feelings, and at
the end of five minutes he asked:</p>

<p>“What do you know?”</p>

<p>Sparrow scowled and shrugged his shoulders
again.</p>

<p>“I know you make me sick,” he answered
ungraciously.</p>

<p>“You make me a heap sicker,” responded
Jonesie. “Anyone been in?”</p>

<p>“No—yes, there was a fellow in here half
an hour ago asking for you.”</p>

<p>“Who was he?”</p>

<p>“Search me.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing much. Left a note on the table,
I think.”</p>

<p>“You <em>think</em>! Don’t you ever <em>know</em> anything?”
Jonesie got up and found the note.
“It wouldn’t have hurt you a whole lot to have
said something about this when I came in, you
lazy chump!” He glanced at it and thrust it
into a pocket. “It’s important, too,” he added
severely. “You’re a wonder, Sparrow!”</p>

<p>“I forgot it,” said Sparrow untroubledly.
“What’s it about?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.” Jonesie rescued
his cap from the floor, borrowed Sparrow’s
umbrella from the closet and hurried out.</p>

<p>“Come back with that brulla!” shouted Sparrow.</p>

<p>As this produced no result, he shrugged his
shoulders, picked up his book and started reading
again.</p>

<p>The note was signed “James A. Wigman,”
and informed Jonesie that he was rooming at
Mrs. Sproule’s on Center Street, adding that
if Jonesie had time to drop around he’d take
it as a great favor. Now Jonesie was not the
least bit in the world interested in young Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
Wigman. He had scraped acquaintance with
him on the train for no other reason than he
had exhausted all other means of entertainment.
It had amused him to impose upon the
new boy with an assumption of influence which
he by no means possessed, and, once started,
it was Jonesie’s artistic temperament which
had led him to round off the incident with the
presentation of a visiting card and an avowal
of friendly interest. To-day, had there been
anything else to occupy Jonesie’s talents, young
Mr. Wigman’s appeal would probably have
gone forever unanswered. But Jonesie was
bored and a call on the new boy offered at least
some slight variation of the monotony of life.</p>

<p>Wigman had a room to himself at Sproule’s,
a dormer-windowed cell on the third floor. Pictures,
rugs, pillows and knick-knacks had, however,
lent an air of comfort to the white-walled
apartment, and Jonesie, having been gratefully
welcomed by Wigman and escorted to the only
comfortable chair, affably commended the
quarters.</p>

<p>“It isn’t bad, is it?” asked Wigman. “I
brought quite a lot of truck from home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“One has to,” replied Jonesie. “Well, how’s
it going, Wigman?”</p>

<p>“Very well so far, thank you. I haven’t got
my courses quite straightened out yet. I find
I’ve got to take French or German, and I didn’t
expect that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, one of ’em’s required. You won’t mind
’em, though. Better take French. I did. It’s
more use to you. I discovered that abroad. If
you know French you can get around anywhere,
even in Germany. How are you getting
on with football?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, that’s what I wanted to talk to
you about,” said Wigman. “I went out
Wednesday, of course. I suppose I got along
all right. They put me in D Squad. But I
heard to-day that Mr. Cutler is going to let
some of the fellows go Monday.”</p>

<p>Jonesie nodded. “He would, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and—I wondered——” Wigman hesitated
and sought for the right words. “I
thought that perhaps, after what you said on
the train the other day, Jones, that perhaps
you wouldn’t mind—that is—wouldn’t mind—saying
a word for me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>“Hm,” mused Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Wigman hastened to add, “I
don’t want any favors, you understand! And—and
I don’t want you to do it if you’d rather
not, Jones. Only I thought—that if you just
said a word to the Captain he might give me a
chance, you see; let me stay on a little longer.
I’m pretty sure I can make good, but I’m stale
and I’m afraid they’ll let me go Monday.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Jonesie considered thoughtfully.
“Of course,” he went on presently, “there’s
always the Class Team to fall back on. You’d
make that, I guess, without much trouble.”</p>

<p>Wigman’s face fell. “Y-yes, but—but after
what you said the other day, Jones, I—I sort of
want to make the School Team—or the Second,
anyway! You know you said first-year fellows
had done it.”</p>

<p>“Did I? Yes, of course I did! Quite right,
too. By the way, what position are you trying
for?”</p>

<p>“Quarter.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” murmured Jonesie. “That—er—complicates
it, doesn’t it?” In response to
Wigman’s unspoken question he went on. “I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
mean that there’s only one quarterback position
to fill and so, of course, it’s harder. You
see that, eh? Now, if you were trying for end
or tackle or guard or half you’d stand just
twice the chance. Still——”</p>

<p>“I’ve always played quarter,” said Wigman.
“I suppose I might try for half, though.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s no hurry about that,” replied
Jonesie. “I’ll speak to Bing about you. Of
course I can’t promise anything. Bing’s a most
conscientious chap and, while, of course, he’d
do anything in reason for me, he might—er—there
might be some reason why he couldn’t do
this. There’s Cutler, for instance. Awfully
opinionated cuss, that Coach. Hard to work
with. Bing says so himself. Still, you sit tight,
Wigman, and I’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you a thousand times, Jones!”</p>

<p>“Better not thank me until we see how it
turns out,” warned Jonesie. “I may fall down,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Even if you do I—I’ll feel mighty grateful
to you, just the same. And—and I hope you
don’t mind my asking you?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Glad to do anything I can, Wigman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
What’s the good of having influence if
you don’t make use of it for your friends? I
say, that’s a peach of a racket you have!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it isn’t bad. I have another one over
there.” Wigman took down the Smith Special
and handed it across for Jonesie’s examination.
“I haven’t used it but once or twice. It’s
a little too heavy for me, I find. I do better
with the other one. Do you play?”</p>

<p>“Not very much. I’m fond of the game,
though. Used to do fairly well before the doctors
butted in.”</p>

<p>“I forgot about that,” murmured Wigman
sympathetically.</p>

<p>Jonesie weighed the racket in his hand, felt
the grip of it, swung it experimentally to and
fro and tapped the mesh approvingly.</p>

<p>“Some racket that, Wigman. Don’t know
when I’ve run across one I liked as well.
Thanks.” He handed it back. Wigman accepted
it, but did not return it to its place over
the narrow mantel. Instead, he swung it nervously
back and forth behind him, opened his
mouth, closed it and exhibited all the signs of
embarrassment. If Jonesie saw he pretended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
not to. He picked his cap up and lounged across
to the bureau, bending over the row of photographs
displayed.</p>

<p>“This your father, Wigman? Fine-looking
chap, by Jove! You take after him a lot, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” asked Wigman in permissible
surprise. “Folks usually think I look
a good deal more like my mother. That’s her
picture at the end there.”</p>

<p>Jonesie observed it critically, shot a look at
Wigman and shook his head.</p>

<p>“N-no, I don’t think so. Of course there’s a
strong likeness there, too, but it’s your dad
you resemble most, I’d say. Well, I must be
getting along. Sorry I wasn’t in when you
called, Wigman. Try again, will you? I’d like
you to meet my chum, Bowles. Fine fellow,
Bowles. A bit studious for a lazy duffer like
me”—Jonesie’s smile made a joke of that!—“but
we get on first chop. Come over soon,
Wigman. I wish you would.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I—I’d like to. And I’m ever so
much obliged about this—this other business.
It’s frightfully decent of you, Jones!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Piffle,” answered Jonesie deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“It is, though,” Wigman went on earnestly.
“And—and about this thing.” He brought the
racket back into view. “I never use it, Jones,
and I have another one, anyway; and it’s a lot
too heavy for me, besides. And so—so”—Wigman
was making hard work of it, stammering
and blushing—“so I wish you’d take it,
Jones!”</p>

<p>“Take it?” echoed Jonesie uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>“As a gift, you know. I suppose it’s cheeky
on my part, but——”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow!” Jonesie smiled sweetly,
protestingly. “It’s certainly fine and dandy of
you, but I couldn’t think of it! Positively I
couldn’t, Wigman!”</p>

<p>“Well—of course——” The hand holding
the racket fell limply. “I wish you might,
though.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine of you, but—er—hang it, Wigman,
it looks almost like a bribe!”</p>

<p>Wigman colored furiously. “Oh, I didn’t
mean it that way. Honest I didn’t, Jones!
You—you believe me, don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I do! I know better, but others
might think—well, you know what fellows are!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they needn’t know, need they? I
wouldn’t tell. You—you’ve been so awfully
kind to me, Jones, and I don’t know any fellows
yet, and—and I’d just like you to have it!
It would be awfully good of you if you would!”</p>

<p>Jonesie was affected by this appeal. He hesitated
on the very verge of another refusal.
Wigman, seeing it, renewed his appeal.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as though I didn’t have another perfectly
good one, Jones, because I have. I do
wish you would!”</p>

<p>“Why—why, if you put it that way,” murmured
Jonesie, vacillating. “But, I say, Wigman,
it’s worth five or six dollars, you know!”</p>

<p>“Seven,” answered Wigman, “but that’s got
nothing to do with it. I—I’d just like you to
have it. Won’t you, please?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you really want me to——” Jonesie
hesitated still, but Wigman thrust the racket
into his hand. Jonesie, discovering it there,
viewed it with surprise. Then, “Thanks, Wigman,
it’s awfully decent of you, old man. I
really haven’t done anything to deserve this,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
you know, but I’ll accept it in—er—the spirit
it is offered in. And, I say, let’s have a set
some day, will you?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to!” exclaimed Wigman.</p>

<p>“Good!” Jonesie changed the racket to the
other hand and offered the first to Wigman.
“We’ll do it. Good luck, Wigman. Sit tight
and leave everything to me! So long!”</p>

<p>Swinging the racket appreciatively as he entered
the campus, Jonesie almost collided with
a tall, broad-shouldered Upper Classman.</p>

<p>“Hi, kid, look where you’re going,” ejaculated
the latter good-naturedly. Jonesie
stepped out of the way into a puddle.</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Bingham,” he said humbly.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">All that happened on Friday. Saturday
was a wonderful sunny day, and
Jonesie, who had no recitation after
half past ten in the morning, was very, very
busy. There was nine holes of golf with
“Pinky” Trainor before dinner, a visit to the
village with Pinky in the afternoon and a lovely
rough-house evening of it in Steve Cook’s room.
Steve lived at Mrs. Sharp’s in Walnut Place,
and as Walnut Place was a good half mile from
the nearest dormitory and Mrs. Sharp good-naturedly
lenient it was, in Pinky’s words, some
party! Jonesie, Pinky and two other campus
dwellers left at a quarter past ten by way of a
window and a shed roof, skulking back to school
by dark and devious ways. Consequently it
was not until Sunday morning, always a sober
period to Jonesie, that recollection of Wigman
returned to him. The Smith Special reposed
on the mantel and ever and anon as Jonesie<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
wandered about the study donning one garment
after another, his glance fell upon it troubledly.
Naturally Sparrow had been curious about the
tennis racket and Jonesie’s easy statement that
he had “bought it off a fellow” only aroused
Sparrow’s incredulity.</p>

<p>“<em>Bought</em> it! Yes, you did! Bet you stole
it!” jeered Sparrow. Which unjust charge so
outraged Jonesie that he refused further enlightenment.</p>

<p>All during church, or more especially during
the sermon—for Jonesie solved some of his
most momentous problems while the preacher’s
drone filled the quiet church—he considered
Wigman. Something would have to be done,
but he couldn’t see what. He sincerely wished
he had never encountered Wigman. The whole
thing was a nuisance! Of course he had hedged
enough so that if Wigman was dropped from
the football squad to-morrow Wigman couldn’t
hold him to blame. Still, there was that racket.
Jonesie loved that racket and didn’t want to
give it up, which, he supposed, he’d have—well,
<em>ought</em>—to do in case Wigman suffered in the
morrow’s cut. Jonesie frowned and scowled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
and cudgeled his brain, but discovered no solution.
During the rest of the day—especially
what time Jonesie sat and suffered in the composition
of his weekly home letter—the Smith
Special looked down upon him accusingly, reproachfully,
until finally the boy arose and
wrathfully cast it into the closet.</p>

<p>By Monday morning he had forgotten the
Wigman problem. Nor did it occur to him
again until, returning at dusk from an afternoon
on the river in a canoe with Pinky, Sparrow
growlingly indicated a note on the table.
Jonesie’s first glance was at the signature,
and when he read Wigman his heart sank
uncomfortably. Then, taking a long breath,
he moved his gaze to the top of the sheet and
read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Friend Jones</span>:</p>

<p>I can’t thank you enough for what you’ve done. As you
probably saw by the notice they’ve kept me on and to-day
Captain Bingham put me into B Squad. He was awfully
nice, too. Told me I was doing well, and that if I stuck to
it and worked hard I’d make a good quarter. Of course I
knew it was all your doing, and so I didn’t feel too stuck up
about it. I’m terribly much obliged and I hope some time
I’ll have a chance to do something for you. If the time ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
comes I’ll do it like a streak. I haven’t forgotten your invitation
to call, and I’m going to come over some evening if
you don’t mind.</p>

<p class="noic">Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">James A. Wigman</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Jonesie folded the note up with a broad smile.
Then, whistling softly, he went to the closet
and rescued the tennis racket. When it was
once more on the mantel he had a sudden
thought and his gaze darted across to where
Sparrow sat under the drop light, reading.
There was something far too good to be true
in Sparrow’s preoccupation and Jonesie
scowled. At length:</p>

<p>“Anything about this note you’d like to have
explained?” he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>Sparrow looked up, blinking. Then he shook
his head slowly.</p>

<p>“N-no, I guess not. It’s none of my business,
Jonesie.”</p>

<p>“Then what did you open it for?” Jonesie
exploded.</p>

<p>“Why, it was sort of dark in here and I
thought it was for me,” explained Sparrow
calmly. “Of course, when I saw it wasn’t——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“You read it through! After this you leave
my notes alone. Do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I don’t want to read your old notes.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t do it,” growled Jonesie.</p>

<p>“All right. That fellow Wigman must be an
awful fool, though.”</p>

<p>“Why?” challenged the other.</p>

<p>“Why, to give you that racket! I don’t know
what he thinks you did for him, Jonesie, but I’m
mighty sure you didn’t do it!”</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">A fortnight later all Randall’s was
talking about the new football find.
His name was Wigman, he was a Junior,
he was only thirteen years old and he was
turning out to be the finest little quarterback in
years! Why, only the other day he had taken
Rice’s place in the last two periods against
Mercer High and driven the team like a veteran!
To say nothing of having himself scored
on one of the most daring and brilliant end
runs ever seen on Randall’s Field!</p>

<p>When Jonesie heard this he smiled superiorly.
“I knew that a month ago,” he said.
“Wigman and I are old friends. In fact, it was
largely due to my—my encouragement that he
held on and made good. Had an idea when he
got here that things went by favoritism and
was all for giving up right at the start. ‘Don’t
you do it,’ I said to him. ‘You peg along, old
man, and show ’em what you can do. If you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
got the stuff in you Bingham and Cutler will
pull you right along. Why,’ said I, ‘a fellow
who can play the way you can ought to be Captain
some day!’ My very words. You ask
Wigman if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>“But how did you know he could play?” inquired
an incredulous hearer. “Did you know
him before he came up?”</p>

<p>“Never set eyes on him,” declared Jonesie
truthfully, “but you can’t fool me on football
players. I can size ’em up just by looking at
’em. And one little glance at Wigman was
enough for yours truly. He hasn’t surprised
<em>me</em> any. I <em>knew</em>!”</p>

<p>Wigman had fulfilled his promise to call on
Jonesie, but the latter had been out. And as
Jonesie had never returned the visit the acquaintanceship
had not flourished. Jonesie considered
himself well out of his difficulty and was
fearful that Wigman might again request him
to use his influence with Captain Bingham.
But, as it happened, the new quarterback
needed no one’s assistance. He was making
good on his own account, and by the time the
Big Game was a fortnight away it had become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
a question whether Rice, the last year’s general,
could retain his position. And that question
was solved a week later. In the game with
Lakeshore School Wigman started at quarter,
and it was not until the game was safely “on
ice” in the fourth period that the disgruntled
Rice succeeded to the position. That, of course,
was on the Saturday succeeding the final contest
of the year, and the next afternoon, while
Jonesie was chewing the end of his penholder
and scowling at the Smith Special for inspiration
in the composition of his weekly missive,
there was an apologetic knock and in walked
James Andrew Wigman.</p>

<p>Even Jonesie could not help but notice the
change in the boy. He seemed to have grown
taller and broader and a lot more certain of
himself. Shaking hands, Jonesie was thankful
that Sparrow was out of the way, for Wigman’s
countenance proclaimed that he had come on
weighty matters. “If,” said Jonesie to himself,
“he wants me to ask any more favors of
Bingham I’ll just have to refuse. This thing’s
gone far enough!”</p>

<p>Wigman took a chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry to bother you, Jones,” he began
soberly.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” murmured his host uneasily.</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ve heard that they’ve given
me Rice’s place on the School Team?”</p>

<p>Jonesie nodded. “Glad to hear it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, of course it’s mighty hard on Rice.
He’s an awfully fine fellow and he had the place
cinched until I—I butted in.”</p>

<p>“Fortunes of war,” said Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Maybe, and I wouldn’t care if—if I wasn’t
afraid that I—well, had sort of come by my
good luck unfairly.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” ejaculated Jonesie.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Can’t say I do, Wigman.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can’t deny, I suppose, that if it
hadn’t been for you I wouldn’t have got the
chance to show what I could do. Because it’s
dollars to doughnuts, Jones, that Cutler meant
to drop me the second week of practice. You
remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes,” answered the other hurriedly.
“Still——”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what’s bothering me. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
I think I ought to drop out and give Rice
a fair show. I don’t mean that I got my place
by favoritism, exactly, but I guess there’s no
use pretending that if it wasn’t for your interceding
for me with Bingham, Rice would still
be first-string quarter.”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Jonesie judicially.</p>

<p>“And—and that brings me to another thing.
Yesterday after the game I got to thinking
about all this and I thought I’d go to Bingham
and have a frank talk with him. So——”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” groaned Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Pardon? I thought you spoke. So I did.
I told him that I was afraid it was scarcely fair
to Rice and—and suggested that maybe I ought
to—to sort of drop out for this season.”</p>

<p>“What—what did he say?” asked Jonesie
faintly.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s the funny part of it. He said
he didn’t know anything about it! At first he
even pretended he didn’t know who you were!”</p>

<p>“Good Old Bing!” exclaimed Jonesie, slapping
his leg and grinning. “If that isn’t just
like the boy!”</p>

<p>Wigman looked puzzled. “But he said——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Wait!” Jonesie held up a hand. “I’ll tell
you just what he said, Wigman. First off he
pretended he didn’t know what you were talking
about. Didn’t he?” Wigman nodded.
“Then he made believe he didn’t know who I
was. When you explained he said, ‘Oh, Jonesie,
you mean. Ha, ha!’ Just like that. Then he
probably told you straight out that I’d had
nothing to do with the thing, that I’d never
mentioned your name to him and that, even if
I had, it wouldn’t have made a bit of difference.
Didn’t he? Isn’t that about what happened,
Wigman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty nearly exactly. And he said
that the reason they’d put me in place of Rice
was because I was playing a better all-around
game and that nothing else had anything to do
with it.”</p>

<p>“And there you are!” exclaimed Jonesie triumphantly.</p>

<p>“But—but why should he say he didn’t know
you, Jones? He does, of course, and you have
spoken to him for me, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>Jonesie smiled wisely. “He says not, doesn’t
he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but——”</p>

<p>“And he ought to know.” Jonesie winked
meaningly. Vague comprehension illumined
Wigman’s countenance.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he said doubtfully. “You mean he
doesn’t want to acknowledge even to me——”</p>

<p>“Wigman, there’s a whole lot more politics
in a school like this than you dream of,” responded
Jonesie gravely. “Bing has his reason.
Let it go at that. Don’t inquire too—er—closely.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Then you think——”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Why, that you ought to take what you’ve
got and ask no questions,” said Jonesie
promptly. “Get me?”</p>

<p>“But if they have—have been easier with me
than with other fellows——”</p>

<p>“It’s because you deserved it. Wigman, Cutler
and Bing and I have—er—done what was
wisest and best for you and the School. Remember,
Wigman, there’s the School to think
of, too. The greatest good to the greatest number,
you know. Got to think of that, Wigman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
It may seem a bit tough on Rice, but don’t let
that worry you. Just tell yourself that we
have our reasons, Wigman, reasons which
neither Bing nor I are ashamed of. If it was
necessary we’d tell ’em to the School right out.
But it isn’t. You go ahead and keep your mouth
shut, Wigman, that’s all you need do.”</p>

<p>“And—and,” asked Wigman, visibly impressed,
“you don’t think I’m taking any unfair
advantage of Rice?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. Take my word for it. Besides,
Bing told you the same thing, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There you are then! Don’t you trouble. If
there’s any worrying to be done”—Jonesie
arose and patted Wigman reassuringly on the
shoulder—“if there’s any of that to be done
you just leave it to me and Bing!”</p>

<p class="cap">“I wish,” murmured Tommy Piper, “they’d
let <em>me</em> play!”</p>

<p>It was a chill, cloudy November afternoon,
and Tommy, sprawled in the big armchair
in front of the library fire, was very unhappy.
Things hadn’t gone well to-day at
school, where the teachers had been horribly
unjust to him, nor at home, where he had been
scolded for arriving late for dinner; Billy Blue,
his most particular chum, was confined to the
house with double mumps, and, to add to the
burden of his woes, or to remind him of the
principal one, half a dozen fellows, togged and
sweatered, carrying a battle-scarred football
and dangling their head guards, had just passed
the window on their way to the field to practice
for the final and all-important game of
the year, that with Meadowville.</p>

<p>Usually Tommy went along, envious but interested,
to watch the luckier boys at work, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
to-day he was at outs with the world. What
was most awfully wrong was that George Marquis,
captain of the Hillside eleven, refused to
perceive in Tommy the qualities desired in a
member of that gallant band of gridiron warriors.
George said that Tommy was much too
light for either line or backfield, while grudgingly
acknowledging that he <em>could</em> kick and <em>was</em>
fast on his toes. Consequently, Tommy, who
all summer long had looked forward almost
breathlessly to securing a position at the end
of the line or as a back, had been—and still was—horribly
disappointed. Of course he realized
that he was pretty light—he was only thirteen,
you see, and by no means large for his age—but
he was quite convinced that he was
clever enough at punting and drop-kicking
and carrying the ball to atone for his lack of
weight. But Captain Marquis didn’t think so,
and Tommy was out of it for another year at
least.</p>

<p>He had been trying to read a story that was
all about school life and football, but he didn’t
want his fun at second-hand to-day. He wanted
to make history himself! The book toppled unnoticed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to the hearth rug and Tommy went off
into a wonderful daydream, his round eyes
fixed entrancedly on the glowing coals in the
grate. He saw himself playing right halfback
for Hillside in the Thanksgiving Day game with
Meadowville, making sensational rushes, kicking
marvelous goals from the field, cheered and
applauded, a veritable football hero if ever
there was one! When, after an hour of desperate
battle, Hillside had conquered, and Tommy,
on the shoulders of admiring comrades, was being
carried from the field, he woke from his
daydream with a sigh.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said longingly, addressing no
one in particular, since there was no one there,
but gazing very intently at the gloomy corner
of the room where lounge and bookcase met
and formed a cavern of shadow, “I wish I could
do all that! Gee, but I do wish I could!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said a small, gruff voice that made
Tommy sit up suddenly very straight and surprised
in his chair, “you were long enough
about it!”</p>

<p>From the dark corner there emerged into the
fire light the most astonishing person Tommy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
had ever seen or dreamed of. He was scarcely
higher than the boy’s knee and he was lamentably
thin; and his head was quite out of proportion
to any other part of him. But the queerest
thing of all was his face, which was just as
round as—as, well, as a basket ball and very
much the same color. From the middle of it
protruded a long and very pointed nose. His
eyes were small and sharp and bright and his
mouth was thin and reached almost from one
perfectly huge ear to the other. He was dressed
in rusty black, with pointed shoes that were ridiculously
like his nose, and a sugar-loaf cap,
from which dangled dejectedly a long green
feather. And under one pipestem of an arm,
clutched with long brown fingers, was a football
almost as large as he was!</p>

<p>Tommy stared and stared and thought he
must be dreaming. But the strange visitor
quickly put that notion out of his head.</p>

<p>“Well! Well!” he said crossly. “Can’t you
speak?”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir,” stammered Tommy. “But—I—I
don’t think I heard wh-what you said!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did! You didn’t understand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Boys are all stupid. I said you were long
enough about it.”</p>

<p>The visitor advanced to the hearth and took
up his position on the rug, his back to the fire
and his beady eyes blinking sharply at the boy.</p>

<p>“About—about what?” asked Tommy apologetically.</p>

<p>“About wishing, of course! Don’t you know
fairies can’t grant a wish until it has been made
three times? You wished once and then you
kept me waiting. I don’t like to be kept waiting.
I’m a very busy person. Nowadays, with
everyone wishing for all sorts of silly things
that they don’t need and oughtn’t to have, a
fairy’s life isn’t worth living.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” murmured Tommy apologetically.
“I—I didn’t know you were there.”</p>

<p>“‘Didn’t know! Didn’t know!’ That’s what
every stupid person says. You should have
known. If you didn’t expect me why did you
wish three times?”</p>

<p>“Why, I—I don’t know,” said Tommy. “I
was just—just wishing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then maybe you don’t want your wish?”
asked the other eagerly. “If that’s it, just say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
so. Don’t waste my time. I’ve an appointment
in Meadowville in—in——” He took off his
funny sugar-loaf hat, rested the end of the
feather on the bridge of his long nose and spun
the cap around. “One—two—three—four——”
The cap stopped spinning and he replaced
it on his head. “In four minutes,” he ended
sternly.</p>

<p>“Th-that’s a funny way to tell time,” said
Tommy.</p>

<p>“I never tell time,” replied the stranger
shortly. “Time tells me. Now, then, what do
you say?”</p>

<p>“Th-thank you,” said Tommy hurriedly, remembering
his manners.</p>

<p>“No, no, no, no, no, no!” exclaimed the other
exasperatedly. “What about your wish? Do
you or isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, if it isn’t too much trouble,”
stammered Tommy, “I’d like to have it very,
very much.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s trouble,” said the fairy
sharply. “Don’t be any stupider than you have
to be. But everything’s trouble; my life is full
of trouble; that’s what comes of being a D. A.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“If you please,” asked Tommy politely,
“what does D. A. mean?”</p>

<p>“Director of Athletics, of course. It couldn’t
mean anything else, could it? Really, you do
ask more silly questions! Now then, now then,
look alive!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but—but how?” asked Tommy
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Repeat the incan., of course.”</p>

<p>“The—the incan——?”</p>

<p>“Tation! Don’t tell me you don’t know it!”
The fairy was almost tearful and Tommy naturally
felt awfully ashamed of his ignorance.
But he had to acknowledge that he didn’t, and,
casting his eyes toward the ceiling in protest,
the fairy rattled off the following so rapidly
that it was all Tommy could do to follow him:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I wish this once,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">I wish this twice!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Grant me the wish</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">That I wish thrice!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Repeat, if you please!” said the fairy.
Tommy did so, stumblingly.</p>

<p>The fairy grunted. “Stupid!” he muttered.
“Didn’t know the incan. What are we coming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
to? What are we coming to? In the old days
boys didn’t have to be told such things. Modern
education—puh!” And the fairy fairly
glared at Tommy.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Mr. Fairy,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hm, at least you have manners,” said the
fairy, his ill temper vanishing. “Well, here it
is.” He tapped the football he held with the
claw-like fingers of his other hand.</p>

<p>“But—but I didn’t wish for a football,” faltered
Tommy disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Of course you didn’t! Who said you did?
You wished you might play in Thursday’s football
game and be a hero and win the game for
your team, didn’t you? Or, if you didn’t, how
much? Or, other things being as stated,
when?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I did! And could I—could you
really give me my wish?”</p>

<p>“Drat the boy! What am I here for? Wasting
my time! Wasting my time! Fiddledunk!”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p>“I said fiddledunk. I always say fiddledunk
when angry. What do you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>“I say—I say——” Tommy had the grace to
blush.</p>

<p>“I know!” exclaimed the fairy triumphantly.
“You say jerriwhizzum! You shouldn’t! It’s
almost swearing! You’re a very bad boy, and
I don’t know that you ought to have your
wish!”</p>

<p>“But I don’t!” gasped Tommy. “I never
said jerriwhizzum in my life.”</p>

<p>“You just said it! Don’t tell me! Don’t tell
me! Guilty or not guilty? Guilty! Remove
the prisoner!” And the fairy grinned gleefully
and maliciously at Tommy.</p>

<p>“But—but I meant I never said it before,
sir!”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say what you mean?” demanded
the other evidently disappointed.
“Are you or for what purpose did you not?
Answer yes or no immediately. No answer.
Discharged! Now then, what do you say?”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Tommy
promptly. The fairy smiled.</p>

<p>“Not at all! Not at all! Glad to be of service.
You have excellent manners—for a boy.
Perhaps in time you’ll get over being so stupid.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
I did. I used to be awfully stupid. You
wouldn’t believe it now, would you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed,” cried Tommy. The fairy
actually beamed.</p>

<p>“I took a correspondence course, you see.”</p>

<p>“A correspondence course?” murmured
Tommy questioningly.</p>

<p>“In Non-Stupidity. Try it.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I—I might some time.”</p>

<p>“Time!” exclaimed the fairy, twirling his
hat again on the tip of the feather and counting
the spins; “dear me! Dear me! I’m—seven—eight—nine—nine
minutes late! Did
you ever? I really must go, I really must. Here
is the Magic Football——”</p>

<p>“Oh, is it a magic football?” exclaimed
Tommy in surprise.</p>

<p>“Of course it is! There you go again with
your silly questions! Taking up my time!
Didn’t I just tell you that I was—— How many
minutes late did I say?”</p>

<p>“Nine, I think.”</p>

<p>“‘You think’! You ought to know. Now I’ll
have to do it again.” He spun the hat and it
stopped at six. “I thought you were wrong,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
he said in triumph. “You said it was nine!
Stupid!”</p>

<p>Tommy thought it best not to argue with him.
“What—what do I do with the football?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Play with it, of course. Didn’t think it was
to eat, did you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but——”</p>

<p>“This football will do everything you want
it to. If you want it to come to you, you say,
‘Come’; if you want it to go, you say——”</p>

<p>“Go!” murmured Tommy.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” exclaimed the fairy testily. “I
wish you wouldn’t jump to conclusions. If you
want it to go you say ‘Og!’”</p>

<p>“Og?” faltered Tommy.</p>

<p>“Of course. When the ball comes to you it
comes forward. When it goes away from you
it must go backward. And ‘go,’ backward, is
‘og.’ I never saw anyone so stupid!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” murmured the boy. “But suppose I
kick the ball?”</p>

<p>“Say ‘Og.’ But you’d better not kick it very
hard, because if you do it might not like it.
Magic footballs have very tender feelings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“But suppose I wanted to kick it a long, long
distance?”</p>

<p>“Then say ‘Og’ several times. You’ll have
to try it for yourself and learn the ography of
it. Now call it.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Tommy doubtfully.</p>

<p>The next instant the football was rolling into
the fireplace, having jumped from the fairy’s
arms, collided violently with Tommy’s nose and
bounced to the floor again.</p>

<p>“Save it!” shrieked the fairy, jumping excitedly
about on the rug.</p>

<p>But Tommy’s eyes were full of tears, produced
by the blow on his nose, and by the time
he had leaped to the rescue the ball was lodged
between grate and chimney and the fairy, still
jumping and shrieking, was quite beside himself
with alarm. Tommy pulled the football
out before it had begun to scorch, however, and
the fairy’s excitement subsided as suddenly as
it had begun.</p>

<p>“Stupid!” he said severely. “You almost
made me ill. The odor of burning leather always
upsets me. It was most unfeeling of
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“But I didn’t know,” replied Tommy with
spirit, rubbing his nose gingerly, “it was going
to come so hard!”</p>

<p>“You should have known. Seems to me, for
a boy who goes to school, you are very deficient
in ography and comeology.”</p>

<p>“I never studied them. We don’t have them.”</p>

<p>The fairy sighed painfully. “What are we
coming to? What are we coming to? Never
studied ography or comeology or non-stupidity!
Oh dear! Oh my!” His long, thin, pointed
nose twitched up and down and sideways under
the stress of his emotion. “Well, well, there
isn’t time to give you a lesson now. You’ll
have to do the best you can. I’m very late. By
the way, when you’re through with the football
just say ‘Og!’ seven times and it will come
back to me. But be careful not to say it seven
times if you don’t want to lose it. Thank you
for a very pleasant evening.” The fairy made
a ridiculous bow, hat in hand, and backed away
toward the dark corner of the room. Tommy
started to remind him that it wasn’t evening,
but concluded that it would only offend him,
and so he didn’t. Instead,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you very much for the football,” he
said. “Would you mind telling me who it is
you are going to call on in Meadowville?”</p>

<p>“The name is—the name is——” The fairy
lifted one foot and peered at the sole of a
pointed shoe. “The name is Frank Lester.
Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but I know who he is,” answered
Tommy anxiously. “He’s captain of the Meadowville
Grammar School Football Team, and
I’ll just bet he’s going to wish they’ll win the
game!”</p>

<p>The fairy frowned with annoyance. “I can’t
have that,” he said, shaking his head rapidly.
“Besides, all the magic footballs are out. He
will have to wish for something else.”</p>

<p>“But—but suppose he doesn’t?”</p>

<p>“‘Suppose!’ ‘Suppose!’ I’d just like to
know,” exclaimed the fairy, “how many supposes
you’ve supposed! You’re the most suppositionary
boy I ever did see!”</p>

<p>“But if he <em>did</em> wish that,” pursued Tommy,
“you’d have to give him his wish, wouldn’t
you?”</p>

<p>The fairy grinned slyly and put a long finger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
beside his nose. “If wishes were fishes,” he
said, “beggars would ride.”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t think that’s just the way it
goes,” said Tommy.</p>

<p>“Then don’t ask me,” replied the other indignantly.
“Besides, you have kept me here
until I am awfully late for my appointment. I
must be—I must be——”</p>

<p>The fairy caught off his hat and began twirling
it about on the tip of the feather.</p>

<p>“One—two—three——!” he began to count.</p>

<p>The hat twirled like a top and Tommy, watching
it, felt his head swim and his eyes grow
heavy.</p>

<p>“Twelve—thirteen—fourteen—twenty-eight——”
came the voice of the fairy as though
from a long ways off. Tommy wanted to tell
him that twenty-eight didn’t follow fourteen,
but he was too sleepy to speak.</p>

<p>“Thirty-three—thirty-six—thirty-two—fifteen——”</p>

<p>It was just a whisper now, away off in the
hazy distance....</p>

<p>Tommy sat up suddenly and stared. The
fairy was gone. He rubbed his eyes. After all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
then, it was just a dream! But as he stirred
something rolled from his lap to the floor and
went bouncing away under the couch. It was
the magic football.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">All that happened on Saturday afternoon.
Monday morning Tommy
sought George Marquis at recess and
asked him to let him play on the football team.
“If you do,” he said earnestly, “I’ll win the
game for you.”</p>

<p>George laughed amusedly. “How’ll you do
it, kid?” he asked, with a wink at Harold Newman,
the quarterback.</p>

<p>Tommy flushed. “I—I can’t tell you that,”
he stammered. “It—it’s a secret. But I can
do it, George; honest and truly, black and
bluely! Just let me show you, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shucks,” said the captain, “if you know
how to win the game you can tell me about it,
can’t you? Anyway, I guess we can win it without
you and your secrets, Tommy.”</p>

<p>But Tommy looked so disappointed that
George, who was kind-hearted after all, said
soothingly: “I tell you what I will do, Tommy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
If we’re ahead at the end of the third period,
I’ll let you go in at half. How’s that?”</p>

<p>“You won’t be,” replied Tommy glumly.
“If you really want to lick Meadowville,
George, you’d better let me play. If you don’t
you’ll be sorry for it. I can win that game for
you, and I don’t believe anyone else can.”</p>

<p>George’s good nature took flight. “Oh, you
run away, kid!” he said impatiently. “Anyone
to hear you talk would think you were a regular
wonder! You’re too fresh!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Tommy to himself
as George went off scowling, “but you’ll have
to let me play whether you want to or not! Unless,”
he added doubtfully, “that fairy is just
a—a fakir after all!”</p>

<p>But that didn’t seem probable, for there was
the magic football, and the magic football did
just as the fairy had said it would. That afternoon
when he was let out of school half an
hour late—Tommy’s head was so filled with
football these days that there was almost no
room in it for lessons and he was kept after
school as a result—he hurried home, unlocked
the closet door in his bedroom and took the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
magic football down from the shelf. It looked
just like any other football. There was the
name of a well-known maker stamped on the
clean leather and no one would have ever suspected
that there was anything unusual about
it. But there certainly was, as Tommy proceeded
to prove when, the ball under his arm,
he reached the vacant lot behind the dye works
in the next street. The dye works had no windows
on the back, there was a tumble-down
board fence around the other three sides of the
lot and Tommy was safe from observation.</p>

<p>When he had crawled through a hole in the
fence he placed the football on the ground,
swung his leg gently and said, “Og!” softly as
his foot struck the ball. He hardly more than
touched it with the toe of his scuffed shoe, but
the ball flew up and away as straight as an
arrow and bounced away from the fence at the
further end of the lot. Tommy looked carefully
about him. No one was within sight, and
so he said, “Come!” very softly, and the ball began
rolling toward him along the ground. That
was too slow, and so Tommy said, “Come!”
once more and a little louder. Whereupon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
ball left the ground and arched itself toward
him. Tommy held out his hands, and the ball
settled into them.</p>

<p>That day and every afternoon until Thursday
Tommy continued his practice with the
magic football until finally he was able to judge
just how to address it to get the results he
wanted. For a short kick or pass one “Og,”
not very loud, was enough. For a longer kick
a single “Og” spoken loudly accomplished the
purpose. For a very long kick, say thirty or
thirty-five yards, beyond which Tommy had
never tried to kick a ball, three “Og’s” were
sufficient. And the same rule worked when he
wanted the ball to come to him. He could make
it just trickle toward him slowly across the
turf or he could make it come slam-banging
to him so hard that as often as not he jumped
out of its way so it would not knock him down.
When he did that the ball, instead of going
past, stopped short in the air and dropped to
the ground. In fact, Tommy learned what the
fairy had called “ography” and “comeology.”</p>

<p>A funny thing happened the next day. When
he got home after school—he wasn’t kept in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
that afternoon, for there was a teacher’s council
in the Superintendent’s office—it occurred to
him that perhaps it wasn’t necessary for him
to go up and get the ball, even though it was
in the closet with the door locked. At all events,
he thought, there was no harm in trying it.
So he said “Come!” very loudly and waited
halfway up the front path. But nothing happened;
not even when he said “Come!” again,
very much louder. But when, for the third
time, he said “Come! Come!” almost at the
top of his lungs, something did happen. There
was a frightful noise at the top of the house, a
scream from Tilda, the maid, and a grunt from
Tommy himself! When Tommy picked himself
up, gasping for breath, he was six feet nearer
the front gate and the football was bobbing up
and down in front of him. It had taken him
squarely in the stomach!</p>

<p>When he went into the house Tilda was sitting
halfway up the stairs having hysterics, an
overturned pail beside her and a flood of soapy
water trickling down the steps. Something, declared
Tilda, when she had been calmed by the
use of smelling salts and other restoratives,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
something had flown at her as she was going
upstairs and clean knocked the feet from under
her! Just what the something was Tilda
couldn’t say, but she was sure that it had been
“as big as a washtub, mum, and kind of yellow,
with two big glaring eyes!” Tommy, hiding
the magic football behind him, crept up to
his room. In the top of the closet door was a
big jagged hole and the floor was littered with
splinters!</p>

<p>Tommy looked and gasped. Then he stared
at the magic football. “I guess,” he muttered,
“I won’t try that again!”</p>

<p>On Wednesday he went out to see practice.
What he saw didn’t impress him greatly. Hillside
didn’t play like a team that was going to
win on the morrow. The scrub eleven held the
School Team to one touchdown and a very lucky
field goal, and, when practice was over, the supporters
of the home team came back looking
very dejected. Tommy waited for George Marquis
at the gate.</p>

<p>“George,” he said, twitching the captain’s
sleeve, “don’t forget what I told you!”</p>

<p>Captain Marquis pulled his arm away and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
scowled angrily at the youngster. “Oh, dry up,
Tommy,” he muttered. “You make me tired!
I’ve got enough troubles without having to listen
to your nonsense!”</p>

<p>Tommy went home and wondered for the
hundredth time whether that fairy was putting
up a game on him. Suppose, after all, the fairy
had just been poking fun at him! If George
didn’t let him play how was he ever going to
win the game for Hillside? It was all well
enough to have a magic football that would
come or go just as you wanted it to and that
would break its way through closet doors and
scare folks into hysterics, but if you didn’t get
into the game what good were a dozen such
things? Tommy was sad and doubtful and
pessimistic that evening.</p>

<p>But the next morning he felt more hopeful.
To reassure himself he went over to the vacant
lot with the football and put it through its
paces to his entire satisfaction. And then,
since it was Thanksgiving Day and the big
game was to start at half past ten, he tucked
the magic football in the hollow of his arm and
joined the crowd that was wending its way to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
the field. He passed Billy Blue’s house on the
way, and, in answer to his whistle, Billy appeared
at an upstairs window with his face
swathed in cotton batting and linen and waved
to him sadly.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get the football?” mumbled
Billy enviously.</p>

<p>“A fair—a fellow gave it to me,” answered
Tommy. “Or maybe he just loaned it to me.
It—it’s a wonder!”</p>

<p>“Going to the game?”</p>

<p>“Yep. Wish you were, Billy.”</p>

<p>“So do I! We’ll get licked, though.”</p>

<p>“Bet you we don’t! Bet you we win!”</p>

<p>Billy tried to say “Yah!” but it hurt too
much and so he contented himself with shaking
his head and looking sarcastic. “Yes, we
will!” he mumbled. “Like fun!”</p>

<p>“We will, though, and, Billy——” Tommy
sank his voice so the passers wouldn’t hear.
“Want me to tell you something nobody else
knows?”</p>

<p>Billy nodded.</p>

<p>“I’m going to win it for ’em!” confided
Tommy in a stage whisper. Then, with a magnificent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
wave of his hand, he went on, pursued
by Billy’s cruel and incredulous, if much
smothered, laughter.</p>

<p>We needn’t dwell on that first thirty minutes
of the game. From the point of view of
Hillside it was a sad affair. Meadowville outrushed,
outpunted, outgeneraled her opponent.
The Hillside line couldn’t hold against the
swift, hard attack of the visitors, and the Hillside
ends were no match for the fast backs of
the Meadowville team. When the first fifteen-minute
period was at an end the score was 6
to 0. When the half was over and the rival
teams trotted off the gridiron, the score stood
Meadowville, 17; Hillside, 0!</p>

<p>Tommy, hunched up on a seat in the grandstand,
the magic football clasped to his breast,
watched and worried and almost wept. The
fairy’s promise wasn’t coming true after all!
He wasn’t to have his wish! All his lessons
in “ography” and “comeology” were to be
wasted! The magic football might just as well
be back on the closet shelf, or, for that matter,
back in Fairyland! Tommy felt very sorry
for himself, very disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>But he made one last, final appeal before
yielding to the inevitable. He left his seat and
squirmed through the crowd to the home team’s
bench when Captain Marquis and his players
came back, blankets and spirits both trailing.
He got George’s attention for a minute finally,
and reminded him of his promise. George was
cross and impatient. “You again?” he exclaimed.
“Promise? What promise? Oh,
that? Well, I said if we were ahead, didn’t I?
We aren’t ahead, so that settles that. Now get
off the field, Tommy.”</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t, though. He carried his football
to the bench and seated himself on it, unchallenged,
among the substitutes. They were
all too discouraged to care what Tommy did.
Then the whistle sounded again and the game
went on. The pigskin floated in air, was caught
by a fleet-footed Meadowville player and
brought back for many yards, the Hillside ends
failing lamentably to stop the runner. A plunge
at the line and another five-yard mark was
passed. A wide end run and two more were
traversed. Meadowville was literally eating up
the ground, while from across the field came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the triumphant shouting of her supporters.
And then, not three minutes after the third
quarter began, a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>The football in use, a perfectly good, brand-new
football, supplied by the home team at a
vast expense, began to become deflated. A halt
was called and the lacings were undone and
they tried to blow it up again. But the air
wouldn’t stay in it! It was most perplexing
and most annoying. No one had ever seen a
football act so before. But there was only one
thing to do, and that was to find another ball.
Of course, Hillside ought to have had another
one, but she didn’t; at least, not at the field.
There was an old football at George’s house,
but George’s house was a good mile and a half
away. So it devolved on Meadowville to loan
her practice ball and the Meadowville captain,
after sarcastically stating what he thought of
the stinginess of Hillside, consented to have
the ball used. But when they went to look for
it, it couldn’t be found! It had been there a
half hour before; they were all quite certain
of that; but it wasn’t there now. Boys searched
everywhere, even behind the stand, but to no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
avail. And then, just when Captain Marquis
concluded that he would have to dispatch a messenger
to his house for the old football, someone
brought word that Tommy Piper had a football
and that he was sitting on the bench at that
moment. Over hurried George.</p>

<p>“Let’s take your ball, Tommy,” he said
genially. “Ours is busted.”</p>

<p>Tommy smiled and shook his head. George
blustered.</p>

<p>“Come on! We’ll pay you for it, if you
won’t lend it! Don’t be a meany!”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend it to you for nothing if you’ll let
me play left halfback,” said Tommy. A howl
of derision went up from the players and substitutes.
George scowled angrily.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of being a hog?” he demanded.
“Come on, let’s have it!”</p>

<p>But Tommy shook his head. George grabbed
the ball and tried to tug it away. Tommy said
“Come!” very softly under his breath and, although
Harold Newman and Bert Jones and
Gus Neely all helped their captain, not an inch
would that ball budge! They had to give it up.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him play,” said Harold, very much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
out of breath. “It won’t matter, George.
We’re beaten anyway.”</p>

<p>George, very angry, hesitated and finally
yielded. “All right,” he said gruffly. “You
can play. Give us the ball. Gus, you’re off.”</p>

<p>Tommy, the recipient of a look of deadly
hatred from the deposed Gus, trotted joyfully
into the field and took his place. Harold whispered
the signal code into his ear. “You won’t
be able to remember it,” he added, “but you
won’t get the ball, so that doesn’t matter!”</p>

<p>Then the game began again. Meadowville
was on her second down, with four yards to go.
The quarterback called his signals, the two lines
heaved together and——</p>

<p>“Ball! Ball!” shouted half the players. The
Meadowville quarter had fumbled and, strange
to say, it was Tommy who dropped to the turf
and snuggled the ball to him. For almost the
first time the Hillside supports had something
to cheer about and they made good use of the
chance. And half the Hillside team patted
Tommy on the back as he was pulled to his feet.
Of course, it was only an accident, but Tommy
deserved credit just the same!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Hillside was on her forty-yard line when she
got the pigskin and Harold Newman elected to
have Bert Jones, the big fullback, take it for
a try through right tackle. And so he called
the signals, and the players crouched in their
places and the ball was snapped. And then, as
Bert leaped forward to take the pass from
quarter, Tommy whispered, “Come!”</p>

<p>Such a befuddled-looking backfield as that
was for an instant! Bert, expecting the pigskin,
clasped empty air to his stomach and hove
himself at the line. The other backs stood and
stared; all, that is, save Tommy. Tommy was
very busy. Already, with the ball snuggled in
the bend of his arm, he had crossed two white
lines and he was very intent on crossing the
rest of them. That he didn’t was only because
the opposing quarterback outguessed him and
brought him to earth.</p>

<p>But twenty-five yards was not to be sneezed
at, especially when theretofore the most that
Hillside had made in one try was a scant six!
George Marquis stopped scolding Harold and
hugged Tommy instead. Harold, too, thumped
him delightedly on the back, but the quarter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
had a dazed look on his face. He could have
sworn that he had tossed the ball toward Bert
Jones!</p>

<p>Slightly demoralized, Meadowville lined up
again in front of her foe. This time she
watched Tommy as a cat watches a mouse, but
when Tommy, disregarding the play, scuttled
yards across the field, the rival backs decided
that he was faking an end run and paid scant
attention to him. A moment after they saw
their mistake, for the ball went to Tommy on
one of the prettiest passes ever seen, and
Tommy, almost unopposed, streaked straight
for the Meadowville goal line! Only an end
came near him and Tommy eluded the end
deftly. Tommy was really a clever runner, say
what you like. The opposing quarter tried desperately
to intercept Tommy before he reached
the goal line, but he failed and the best he could
do was to tackle him behind and prevent him
from centering the ball.</p>

<p>You can imagine how Hillside cheered then!
It was deafening, terrific! Even staid and serious-minded
elderly gentlemen shouted and
thumped the stand with their gold-headed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
sticks. Girls screamed their pretty throats
hoarse and boys—well, boys threw their hats in
air and behaved like joyous lunatics! As for
the Hillside players, they turned handsprings
and tripped each other up and behaved quite
ridiculously. All save Tommy. Tommy, a little
breathless, but wearing his honors modestly,
yielded the ball and trotted back up the field
amid a shower of congratulations. And not until
Bert Jones was directing the pointing of the
pigskin did it occur to George Marquis to demand
of Harold why he had signaled one thing
and done another! And poor Harold, looking
very white and worried, could only shake his
head and gaze fascinatedly at Tommy!</p>

<p>But why go into further details of that last
half? At the end of the third quarter Hillside
was two points ahead of Meadowville, and
Tommy Piper had only to turn his head or lift
his hand to have the Hillside stand rise to its
feet and cheer itself hoarse! Such runs as
Tommy made! Ten yards, twenty, even once a
full thirty-five! Never was such brilliant running
and dodging seen before! Tommy could
have played that whole game alone had he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
wished it, but he didn’t. With the assurance
that his team would emerge victor in the end,
Tommy let the other backs have their chances.
And when they were stopped in their tracks or
pushed back for a loss, then the ball went to
the infallible Thomas Piper and said Thomas
reeled off a dozen yards, or two dozen, perchance;
and everything was lovely.</p>

<p>When the last quarter began Meadowville
was showing the strain. So was the Hillside
quarterback! Poor Harold was beginning to
think that he had gone crazy. Time after time
when he tried to pass the ball to one of the
other backs or even carry it himself, he found
that, for some strange reason, without wanting
to do it, he had thrown it to Tommy. Of course,
Tommy always gained and that made it all
right. Only—well, Harold was certainly worried!</p>

<p>A run the entire length of the field, barring
ten yards, was Tommy’s heart-stirring contribution
at the beginning of the final period, and
from that time on until, within only a minute
to spare and the ball on Hillside’s thirty-two
yards, he ended the game in a final blaze of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
glory, Tommy performed like a—well, like a
magician. I can think of no better word!</p>

<p>But the last feat of all was the most astounding.
It went down in history, I can tell you!
Even yet no other player has ever come within
at the least twenty yards of duplicating Tommy’s
performance. The score was 36 to 17
when the final sixty seconds began to tick themselves
away. Hillside had the game safe, and
it didn’t matter very much what happened then.
So when Tommy said to Harold: “Let me try
a field goal from here, Harold,” the quarterback
only stared and didn’t tell him he was
crazy. He only grinned. And then, since they
all owed the victory to Tommy, he consented.
What did it matter how the contest ended? As
well one way as another. And he’d be pleasing
the redoubtable Tommy. So Tommy walked
back to near the twenty-five-yard line and held
out his hands, and everyone stared in surprise.
For why, with everything her own way, should
Hillside punt and lose possession of the ball?</p>

<p>Tommy was ambitious to outdo all his previous
feats, and he could think of but one way
to gain that end, and that was to make a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
field goal. But when, with poised arms,
he awaited the ball and looked far down the
field at the distant goal posts he began to have
doubts. Perhaps the magic football couldn’t go
so far. It was an appalling distance. But just
then the ball was snapped and Tommy said,
“Come!” Straight and true it sped into his
hands. <a href="#i_frontis">Tommy</a> measured distance and direction
again, dropped the ball and, as it bounded,
<a href="#i_frontis">hit it smartly with his instep. And</a> as he did
so he <a href="#i_frontis">said, “Og!”</a> very loudly, and then, to
make very certain, he said, “Og!” again and
again and many times, and kept on saying it
until the enemy came swarming down on him
and sent him sprawling on his back.</p>

<p>But he was up again in a second, watching
the flight of the ball, and, lest it might falter
on its journey, he said, “Og!” once more, or,
perhaps, the fifteenth time.</p>

<p>Friend and foe alike turned and watched the
football. Everyone held his breath. Surely it
would never travel so far! And yet it kept on
going, getting higher and higher until, by the
time it reached the end of the field, it was yards
and yards and yards above the goal posts. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
great awe hushed the field. You could have
heard a pin drop. And then a great cry of
amazement started and spread, for the magic
football kept on going up and up and up and
getting smaller and smaller and smaller until,
at last, it was just a speck against the blue and
then—why, then it wasn’t anything at all! It
had just floated out of sight like a runaway toy
balloon!</p>

<p>But everyone agreed that it had passed exactly
over the center of the Meadowville goal,
and so what did it matter if the ball was lost?</p>

<p>Tommy, being borne off the field on the shoulders
of enthusiastic admirers, cheered and
waved at, smiled modestly. But under that
smile was a sorrow. The magic football was
lost to him!</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Tommy, sadly, to himself, “I
must have said ‘Og!’ seven times!”</p>

<p class="cap">“Want to buy him?” asked the stableman,
including both boys in his
glance, but appealing more particularly
to Jonesie, a healthy, rosy-cheeked
youth of fourteen with a countenance that
fairly radiated candor and innocence. Jonesie
viewed the man with polite indifference.</p>

<p>“What for?” he asked. The stableman,
tipped back in his chair by the door marked
“Office,” shrugged his shoulders and gave the
straw between his teeth a new tilt.</p>

<p>“Thought maybe you’d like a good sporting
animal,” he responded. “In my time it was
considered very swell for young gentlemen to
keep dogs.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean ‘sporting animal’?” inquired
Jonesie coldly. “Can he hunt?”</p>

<p>“Can he! Say, son, that dog’s the finest pup
on—on rabbits and coons and—and——”</p>

<p>“Bears,” suggested Pinky helpfully. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
was a slim youth with a freckled face and carroty
hair.</p>

<p>“Huh!” Jonesie refused to be impressed.
“Any old dog can hunt. Question is, can he
catch anything except fleas.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” asked the
man with a show of anger. “Have a look at
that coat on him, son. If you can find a
flea——”</p>

<p>At that moment the dog, who had been sitting
in the doorway interestedly following the
conversation, turned his head suddenly and began
a hurried and very earnest search along
the inch and a half of tail that the dictates of
fashion had left to him. Jonesie chuckled.</p>

<p>“No use my looking,” he said. “<em>He’ll</em> catch
’em.”</p>

<p>The stableman refused to notice the dog’s occupation.
He also passed over Jonesie’s remark.
“He’s got a skin just like a baby’s, that
dog has. Three months old, and a few days
over, gentlemen, and a ten-spot takes him!
What do you say, now? There ain’t a finer-bred
fox terrier in town. He’s got a pedigree
as long as his tail!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” replied Jonesie.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of a rabbit dog when there
aren’t any rabbits?” asked Pinky. “Nor coons,
neither. If you’ve got a dog that can kill
rats——”</p>

<p>“Rats? <em>Rats!</em>” The stableman almost
choked in his excitement. “Now you’re talking,
son! You wouldn’t believe it, I guess, if I
told you how many rats that dog killed yesterday
afternoon inside of an hour and a half,
right here in this stable.”</p>

<p>“Right-O!” said Jonesie. “We wouldn’t.
So go ahead.”</p>

<p>The stableman fixed him with a glittering
eye. “Fourteen,” he said impressively. “And
one got away.”</p>

<p>Pinky brightened. Jonesie looked coldly incredulous.
The terrier, having failed in his
hunt, sighed and returned to his rôle of interested
audience. He was really a nice little dog.
Clean him up, thought Jonesie, and he’d look
fine. He was all white except for a dark-brown
patch over his left eye and ear, which gave him
a peculiarly philosophical expression. His yellow-brown
eyes were bright and intelligent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
the occasional wag of that pathetic button that
had once been a perfectly good tail showed
friendliness. Jonesie was melting, but you’d
never have suspected it. Pinky stooped and
snapped his fingers and said, “Here, pup,” in
a coaxing voice. The dog wagged the remains
of his tail frantically, but moved not an inch.
Jonesie frowned.</p>

<p>“Shucks, he don’t even come when he’s
called!” he said.</p>

<p>“Not to strangers, he don’t,” replied the stableman
triumphantly. “He’s got to know you
first. Sign of a good dog, that is. He won’t
never know but one master.” Then, with a
quick glance at Pinky, “Leastway, two,” he
added hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Let’s buy him,” urged Pinky, sotto voce.</p>

<p>“What’s the use? They won’t let you have
dogs in dormitories. Besides, he isn’t worth
any ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“We could keep him here at the stable,” said
Pinky eagerly. “You’d board him for us,
wouldn’t you?” he asked the stableman. The
latter nodded hesitantly.</p>

<p>“I guess so. I’ve got a stall he could have.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>The boys went over and patted the dog, and
the dog licked their hands and strove to reach
their faces with his eager pink tongue. “Nice
dogums,” said Pinky. “Didums want to belong
to us?”</p>

<p>The dog replied to the best of his ability that
he did, becoming quite wrought up about it.</p>

<p>“What’s his name?” asked Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Well, I call him Teddy. He ain’t rightly
got a name yet.”</p>

<p>“How much would you keep him for if we
took him?”</p>

<p>“Well, feed’s high nowadays,” replied the
man thoughtfully. “But—say a dollar and a
half a week.”</p>

<p>Pinky whistled and looked doubtfully at his
friend. Jonesie smiled compassionately on the
owner of the dog.</p>

<p>“We weren’t thinking of having him fed on
steak and mushrooms,” he explained patiently.
“Just dog biscuit and a bone now and then
would do, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, say a dollar, then.”</p>

<p>“Say four dollars a month,” returned
Jonesie, “and we pay the end of the month.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“All right, son. What might your name happen
to be?”</p>

<p>“Jones.”</p>

<p>“That so? Thought likely it was Isaacs.”</p>

<p>“You’re a punk thinker, then. How much
will you take for the flea-trap?”</p>

<p>“Meaning the dog? Not a cent less’n ten
dollars, son.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you wanted to sell him.”
Jonesie, hands in pockets, lounged back to the
sidewalk. Pinky regretfully followed. “If I
had ten dollars for a dog,” continued Jonesie
sarcastically, “I’d buy a good one.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t find a better in this town,”
drawled the man indifferently, keeping, however,
a watchful eye on the countenance of the
boy.</p>

<p>“Bet I could buy as good a one as that for
two and a half,” replied Jonesie contemptuously.
The dog watched the boys anxiously
from the doorway. Pinky, observing, felt his
heart melting within him. He tugged at Jonesie’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>“Offer him five,” he whispered. Jonesie
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Offer it to him yourself,” he said aloud,
moving away, “I don’t want him for any five
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Tell you what I will do,” announced the
stableman, “I’ll split the difference and call it
seven-fifty. There, that’s a fair offer, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>Pinky looked undecided. Jonesie, having apparently
lost all interest in the matter, was gazing
off up the village street and whistling
softly.</p>

<p>“Would you?” whispered Pinky.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jonesie from the corner of his
mouth. “He’ll take five in a minute. Don’t let
on you want him.” Then, aloud and impatiently:
“Oh, come on, Pinky! He doesn’t
want to sell; he just wants to talk!”</p>

<p>“Sure I want to sell,” answered the stableman
indignantly. “But I don’t want to make
any presents! Talk sense now. What’ll you
give me?”</p>

<p>“Five dollars,” exploded Pinky. Jonesie
stared at him incredulously.</p>

<p>“Don’t count me in at that price, Pinky,” he
warned. “You come with me and I’ll find you
a dog for half the money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Five dollars!” ejaculated the man. “Well,
what do you know about that! Five dollars for
a three months’ old fox terrier as can trace his
pedigree back to two champions!” Words appeared
to fail him there and Pinky was beginning
to look utterly ashamed of himself when
the stableman found his voice again and inquired:
“Cash down?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, not—not all of it!” stammered
Pinky. He looked appealingly at Jonesie.
“How much you got?” he asked in a hoarse
aside. Jonesie nonchalantly pulled out a pigskin
coin purse and studied its depths.</p>

<p>“I can lend you a dollar and a quarter,” he
replied. Pinky brightened again.</p>

<p>“And I’ve got two,” he said. “Three and a
quarter down now and the rest next week.” He
watched the stableman anxiously. The latter
nodded.</p>

<p>“All right, son. But the dog stays here until
you pay the rest of it.”</p>

<p>“But we don’t pay board for him until he
belongs to us,” responded Jonesie firmly.</p>

<p>“Ho!” The stableman looked at him sourly.
“Thought you was out o’ this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“No, I’ll go halves with my friend,” replied
Jonesie generously. “We’ll come down and see
the dog every day, and if he ain’t a lot fatter
than he is now, we’ll take him away.”
The stableman viewed Jonesie resentfully but
said nothing until the money was in hand.
Then,</p>

<p>“If you expect an active dog like that to get
fat on a dollar a week you’d better take him
right along with you,” he said with deep sarcasm.
“I’ve raised a lot of dogs but I ain’t
never seen no miracles!”</p>

<p>After seeing the dog conducted to the empty
stall that was to be his quarters while he remained
at the stable, and after petting him
awhile, the boys hurried off to school. On the
way up Main Street Pinky said:</p>

<p>“I wonder if he really can catch rats,
Jonesie.”</p>

<p>“Search me! I guess so, though. If he can
we’d ought to charge Perkins something for the
use of him!”</p>

<p>Pinky laughed. “We got him cheap, though,
didn’t we?”</p>

<p>“You mean I did,” corrected Jonesie.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
“You’d have gone and taken him at ten dollars
if you’d had your way.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Pinky humbly.
“When he looked at me that way——”</p>

<p>“Perkins?”</p>

<p>“No, the dog, you silly chump! Say, what’ll
we call him?”</p>

<p>“Spot?” asked Jonesie doubtfully. Pinky
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Every dog is named Spot—or Teddy. He’s
too good a dog to have a name like that. Let’s
think up something decent.”</p>

<p>For the rest of the way there was silence.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Mr. Broadley interrupted
Sparrow Bowles with upraised hand.</p>

<p>“That’s fairly correct, Bowles,” he said.
“But pardon me a moment. Trainor!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“You may hand that to me, if you please.”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” asked Pinky innocently from
the back of the room.</p>

<p>“That note that Jones just passed you.
Hurry, please.”</p>

<p>Pinky dragged himself from his seat, spilling
a Latin book on the floor, and, under the amused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
regard of the rest of the class, walked to the
platform.</p>

<p>“You are both aware,” went on the instructor
as he accepted the piece of paper, “that
passing notes is strictly prohibited at recitations.
You will each do a page of Latin and
bring it to me this evening.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Broadley unfolded the paper
and read:</p>

<p>“Ace, you old fool. He’s got only one spot.”</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">“We might have it here,” said Jonesie,
“only it would make a beast of a noise and
The Terror would be sure to hear it.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no rat-killings in this study,”
said Sparrow decisively. “You fellows can
jolly well go somewhere else.”</p>

<p>Sparrow Bowles was Jonesie’s roommate
and naturally had some rights.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do, anyway,” responded Jonesie,
addressing Pinky, who was perched in dangerous
proximity to the ink-well on the study
table. “If we let the rats out here Sparrow’d
eat ’em himself.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” demanded Sparrow angrily.
“Anyway, I’ll bet I’d catch more of them than
that mongrel pup of yours!”</p>

<p>“Mongrel nothing!” exclaimed Pinky indignantly,
up in arms at once. “You haven’t seen
Ace.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said Jonesie sweetly, “the mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
fact—if it is a fact, Sparrow,—that you’re better
bred than the other dog doesn’t mean that
you can catch more rats. Now, does it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, chase yourself!” growled Sparrow inelegantly.</p>

<p>“Anyway, we’d better have it somewhere
else,” said Jonesie, winking at Pinky as he returned
to the original subject. “I tell you
what! Let’s have it at Steve’s!”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” agreed Pinky. “Steve’ll be
tickled to death. And Mrs. Sharp doesn’t mind
how much rough-house her fellows make. Let’s
go and tell him about it.”</p>

<p>“Where you going to get your rats?” asked
Sparrow, who was deeply interested in the
project in spite of his attitude.</p>

<p>“Catch ’em,” answered Jonesie. “Perkins
has four traps set under his stable now. And
we tied Ace up so he wouldn’t butt in. Oh,
we’ll have rats enough in a day or two! Don’t
you say anything about it, Sparrow. If you do
you won’t be there! Also, we’ll knock your
block off!”</p>

<p>“Like to see you do it,” growled Sparrow.
“Or a dozen fellows like you! Domineering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
kid!” he added as the door closed behind the
others. He picked up the paper-covered novel
he had been reading, replaced his feet on the
radiator and scowled darkly. “Good mind to
put faculty on,” he muttered resentfully. A
grin overspread his thin face. “My word,” he
chuckled, “that <em>would</em> be a lark!”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">III</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">Dear Reader, have you ever personally conducted
five active and anxious rats across a
campus inhabited by hostile faculties at nine
o’clock at night? If so, you will properly appreciate
the difficulties that beset Jonesie,
Pinky and Tubby Bumstead. Unfortunately
Perkins’s stable lay to the west of the school
and Steve Cook was domiciled directly to the
east and the campus lay between. To have
made a detour would have added some eight or
nine blocks to the journey. Hence it was decided
that in this case a straight line between
two points was not only the shortest but wisest
course. With the rats confined in two wire
cages, which were in turn wrapped in oat bags,
and Ace wriggling excitedly in Jonesie’s arms,
only partly hidden by another sack, the three
conspirators crossed the campus, keeping to the
darker paths and avoiding buildings as far as
possible. They walked hurriedly but yet cautiously,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
and as they proceeded strange sounds
escaped from beneath the enfolding bags,
sounds that, had they been heard by a faculty
member, would undoubtedly have occasioned
curiosity. Now it is a well-known fact that
faculties are the most curious persons in the
wide, wide world; always introducing their
noses into other people’s affairs, always athirst
for knowledge that can profit them but little.
Consequently the three boys were extremely
desirous, not to say anxious, that their progress
should go unnoticed. So much so, in fact,
that more than once the sight of a suspicious
figure across the yard caused them to pause in
the shadow of a tree or building and, in a silence
broken only by the agitated squeals of the
rats and the excited and stertorous breathing
of Ace, await the disappearance of the dim and
uncertain form. There were many anxious
moments during that passage of the enemy’s
country, but in the end sheer audacity won and
they climbed the further fence—there were obvious
reasons why gateways were to be avoided—and
hurried across into the gloom of a side
street. From there on it was plainer sailing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
One or two townsfolk, having passed the trio,
turned to peer suspiciously after them, but no
one challenged. At Mrs. Sharp’s luck again
befriended them. When they opened the front
door the hall was empty and six leaps took them
up the stairs, from the summit of which they
gained Steve’s room without detection.</p>

<p>The apartment presented a strangely altered
appearance. The furniture had been moved
against the walls, leaving the center of the
room carpeted with a worn and stained straw-matting,
clear and unobstructed. Occupying
points of vantage atop the desk and the bureau
and strung out along the window-seat, was the
audience. The audience, representative patrons
of sport from the Upper and Lower Middle
classes of Randall’s School, greeted the arrival
of the trio with unrestrained delight, so
unrestrained that Jonesie harshly instructed
them to “cut it out!”</p>

<p>“Let’s see ’em,” begged Steve and Chick
Allen, and the audience climbed down from
their reserved seats and clustered about while
Pinky and Tubby proudly removed the wrappings
and exhibited five badly frightened rats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“Gee,” said Pill Farnham dubiously, “they
aren’t very big, are they? I thought——”</p>

<p>“You thought they were racoons,” interrupted
Jonesie scathingly. “They’re big
enough; don’t you worry. Look at that old
gray fellow. Bet you he will put up a peach of
a fight!”</p>

<p>“Your dog doesn’t seem awfully interested
in ’em,” remarked Pigeon Brown. Which was
a fact, since Ace, having been liberated, was
dodging in and out of the displaced furniture,
sniffing and wagging the stump of his tail, but
apparently quite unaware of the presence of
the rats. Jonesie scowled upon him and demanded
his attention, but the terrier was too
much interested in the contents of the waste-basket
to heed the summons. After a brief but
interesting chase, Pinky dragged Ace from under
the bureau, to which place he had retired
with a banana peel. Ace, confronted with the
rats, put his head on one side, pricked up his
ears when the rodents squealed at sight of him
and wagged his tail amiably. After that he
gazed trustingly and inquiringly at Jonesie and
seemed to be asking permission to continue his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
interesting investigation of the premises.
Pinky’s firm grip on his collar denied him, however,
and Pill Farnham chuckled.</p>

<p>“Bet you he never saw a rat before in his
life, fellows!” said Pill.</p>

<p>Jonesie faced him indignantly. “Didn’t
he?” he inquired with deep irony. “He’s
killed more rats than you ever dreamed of.”
Pill tried to state that he was not accustomed
to dreaming of rats, but Jonesie went on with
growing indignation. “You don’t expect a dog
that’s seen as many rats as he has to throw a
fit, do you? You wait till we let ’em out! Then
you’ll see whether he can kill rats or not! Only
thing I’m bothering about is whether we
oughtn’t to let ’em all out at once. I dare
say one or two at a time won’t be any fun for
him.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be more fun for us, though,” responded
Steve, climbing back to the top of the
table and carefully removing his feet from
proximity to the floor. “Let her go, Jonesie!”</p>

<p>“Are we all here?” asked Jonesie, looking
about. “Where’s Sparrow?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t coming,” answered young Fletcher.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
“Said he had a headache. Told me to tell
you.”</p>

<p>“Headache!” jeered Jonesie. “Too lazy to
walk, I guess! All right, fellows. Get out of
the way now. Which trap shall we open first,
Pinky?”</p>

<p>“This one,” replied Pinky, pushing forward
the cage which held two rats.</p>

<p>“We-ell.” Jonesie studied the scene of combat.
“Now when I open the thing you let Ace
loose. Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Just—just over here,” murmured Pinky,
reaching behind him for the bureau.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be such a coward! A rat won’t
hurt you. Now, then, all ready? Say, for the
love of Mike, turn him toward the cage, can’t
you? Here, Ace? Sick ’em, sick ’em, sir!”</p>

<p>“How many are you going to let out?” asked
Chick from the safe altitude of the window seat.</p>

<p>“Just one this time,” replied Jonesie, struggling
with the door of the cage. “All ready
now, Pinky!”</p>

<p>But Jonesie was mistaken. With the door
open the rats showed a strange disinclination
to leave their prison and face the enemy, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
though the enemy was showing not the slightest
degree of animosity—or even animation!</p>

<p>“Get ’em out!” commanded Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Sick ’em!” cried the patrons of sport in
unison.</p>

<p>Ace looked inquiringly at Jonesie and then
about the room. Pinky shoved him forward.
This Ace took to be an invitation to play, and
immediately dashed at Pinky and licked his
nose, thereby upsetting Pinky’s balance. At
the moment when Pinky’s feet were furthest
from the floor and Ace was dancing about his
struggling form, the rats agreed on a sortie and
dashed from the cage together.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp242">“There they go!”</a> shrieked the excited audience.
<a href="#i_fp242">“Sick ’em, pup! Go after ’em, you fool
dog!”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp242">
  <img src="images/i_fp242.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <br />
  <div class="caption"><a href="#Page_241">“‘There they go! Sick ’em, pup! Go after ’em, you
fool dog!’”</a></div>
</div>

<p>But Ace was having such a fine time jumping
upon Pinky, who was vainly trying to get his
feet under him again, that he neither saw the
rats nor heard the commands. It was only
when Jonesie reached down and delivered a
sounding slap on his brown spot that Ace awoke
to the fact that possibly he had made a mistake.
By that time the rats were gone from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
sight. Jeers and laughter emanated from the
audience. Pinky, arising, red of face and annoyed,
was confronted by an indignant Jonesie.</p>

<p>“You old fool, you!” cried Jonesie. “Why
didn’t you pay attention? Didn’t I tell you
they were coming?”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t you see your fool dog knocked
me over?” inquired Pinky wrathfully. “Why
didn’t you keep them in for a second?”</p>

<p>“How could I keep them in when I’d opened
the door? If you can’t do your share of this
decently, why, say so!”</p>

<p>“Quit your jawing,” advised Steve, “and
catch the rats. It won’t be any fun now, though,
because we won’t be able to see him kill ’em.”</p>

<p>“Kill ’em!” jeered Pill. “That pup couldn’t
kill a straw hat! If I was you, Jonesie, I’d put
him in the closet. If a rat got at him he might
get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” responded Jonesie heatedly.
“You’ll get hurt if you give me any more of
your lip! Which—which way did they go, fellows?”</p>

<p>The replies were confusing. Every member
of the audience insisted on a different locality<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
as harboring the rats. Jonesie looked disgusted.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you fellows might have
watched them and seen which way they went,”
he said. “Got an umbrella, Steve?”</p>

<p>By moving the table slightly young Fletcher,
who was the smallest there, was able to slide
through into the closet. After that the hunt
began. Jonesie used the umbrella, and the rest
of the audience armed themselves with whatever
they could find: tennis rackets, hockey
sticks, even a ruler. Under chairs, table, bureau
the weapons were poked and flourished.
Ace, recovering from the shock of chastisement,
lent eager assistance. The noise became deafening.
Once one of the rats appeared for a
brief moment on top the bureau, left it just
ahead of a racket hurriedly aimed by Pigeon,
landed on the mantelpiece and disappeared
again behind the Morris chair. The only fatality
was a photograph frame. Out came the
Morris chair, there was a squeal and the rat
whisked behind the bureau. Out came the bureau
then, Ace barking frantically and wagging
his stumpy tail in a veritable paroxysm of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
delight. This was a real game! Confusion
reigned supreme. All thought of secrecy had
flown. The excitement of the chase gripped
them all. Shouts and cheers rent the air, Ace
yelped and barked shrilly, sticks banged at
chair legs, furniture was whisked about on
grumbling casters and ten excited patrons of
sport pursued the prey with relentless vigor
and enthusiasm. The waste basket spread its
varied contents across the floor, and even the
pictures on the walls became imbued with the
contagion and danced themselves askew.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a shrill and resentful
expression of grief from Ace, who, all but
the stump of his tail hidden from sight beneath
the Morris chair, had encountered one
of the rats behind the radiator. A cornered
rat will fight, and it was this discovery that
brought the yelp of pain from the terrier. The
alacrity with which he backed out from under
the chair was remarkable. Doubtless his sole
desire was to remove himself from the vicinity
of the painful indignity and consider his
wounded nose. It is not presumable that he entertained
any designs on Tubby Bumstead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
What followed must be laid to Chance. In retreating
from beneath the chair Ace unfortunately
obtruded his hind quarters in the path
of Tubby, who, armed with a hockey stick, was
in full cry. Tubby, being, as his nickname
suggests, somewhat obese, was not able to recover
from the collision with the grace and
celerity of a lither youth. To save himself
Tubby dropped his weapon and grabbed at the
arm of the Morris chair. Now it so happened
that a few moments before someone had
thoughtfully transferred the unopened cage
containing the three rats in reserve from the
floor to that particular arm of the chair. It
would be, perhaps, interesting to pause here
and speculate as to the thoughts and emotions
which possessed those three rats as, elevated
to a position of unrestricted view, they watched
the scene before them. But there is no time.
Tubby’s frantic reach for the support of the
chair dislodged the cage. The cage, in falling,
struck the already nervous Ace on top of the
head. Ace, now thoroughly undone, yielded to
blind, unreasoning terror, a terror which became
absolute panic when the cage, rebounding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
from head to floor, threw open its door and delivered
into the confusion its three prisoners.
That was too much for Ace. With one wild
and piercing howl he fled. As it was not possible
for him to flee in a straight line, he fled
in a circle. For one brief but highly colored
moment life became a kaleidoscopic nightmare
of flying rats, dogs and boys. To be sure, there
was but one dog, but he rotated so rapidly that
it was difficult to believe that he was not in
reality a revolving procession of dogs. And
ever as he went he howled. And ever as he
howled he collided with someone’s legs, and the
owner of the legs toppled ungracefully to earth.
A Futurist could have won immortal fame by
transferring that scene to canvas! And then,
at the zenith of the glorious orgy of movement
and sound, the room door opened and The Terror
stood revealed in all his majesty and severity!</p>

<p>Now Ace, as it happened, had reached a position
in his orbit about midway between window
seat and door when the latter opened. There
was no hesitation on the part of the revolving
body. Leaving its path at a tangent it hurled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
itself at the doorway. It was not Ace’s fault
that Mr. Williams, Instructor in Modern Languages,
was stationed midway between lintel
and lintel. Doubtless Ace tried his best to pass
to one side of The Terror’s none too sturdy
legs. That he did not succeed is not surprising
when we consider the speed at which he was
going and the fact that he had been deprived
of all save a scant two inches of his rudder.
Mr. Williams crumpled against the banisters
across the narrow hall with a loud and expressive
grunt and Ace, rounding the post, hurled
himself down the stairs. Mrs. Sharp, nervously
eavesdropping halfway up the flight, had a momentary
vision of a white streak plunging down
upon her, shrieked hysterically and rolled
slowly and, because of her well-padded condition,
not uncomfortably to the bottom. Ace disappeared
into the night.</p>

<p>The Terror recovered his feet and his dignity
and regained his position in the doorway. Before
him ten boys and five rats maintained silence
and frozen attitudes. The five rats were
not in sight. Nor was one of the ten boys. A
long moment of portentous stillness reigned.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Then The Terror, somewhat pale as yet, pronounced
the names of the nine visible patrons
of sport in a voice which, while still a trifle
shaky, was as icy cold as a blast from the Pole.</p>

<p>“You will all,” concluded The Terror, “report
at the Office to-morrow morning. And
now return to your rooms at once.”</p>

<p>One by one they recovered their caps from
the confusion and filed past him and down the
stairs and into the night. Only Steve remained
in view. Then, with a final glare, Mr. Williams
followed. Simultaneously from behind
the bureau appeared a cautious head.</p>

<p>“Gone?” asked Jonesie hoarsely.</p>

<p>Steve nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>Jonesie extracted himself from concealment
and crawled out of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>. In one hand he
held by the tail a large gray rat, quite dead.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get it?” asked Steve with a
brief flash of interest.</p>

<p>“Back there.” Jonesie nodded toward the
bureau. “I fell on him when I dived in.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere,” responded Steve bitterly,
“there are four more of the things, and I’ve got
to sleep here with ’em!”</p>

<p class="cap">A week has passed. It is a Saturday
morning and Jonesie, immaculately
clad and whistling blithely, is on his
way to the village to make purchases. He has
quite a number of commissions to fill, for nine
of his particular friends and cronies are suffering
probation, a condition which prevents them
from leaving the confines of the school, while
another is recovering slowly from bodily injuries
inflicted by Jonesie with the whole-hearted,
enthusiastic assistance of the nine. Jonesie is
in very good spirits. The sun is warm and the
sky is blue, before him lie the marts of trade
stocked with delectables that appeal to hungry
boyhood, and, while others languish in durance
vile, liberty is his! He is sorry for those others—when
he thinks of them—but his grief is not
deep enough to darken his life.</p>

<p>As he approaches Perkins’s Livery and Sales
Stable a rotund man whittling a stick and chewing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
a straw in front of the office door observes
him with interest. The whittling ceases and the
chair, which has been tilted back against the
stable, comes down on all four legs.</p>

<p>“Hello,” greets the liveryman. “Haven’t
forgot about that dog of yours, have you? You
ain’t been around to see him lately.”</p>

<p>“Dog?” asks Jonesie, wrinkling his innocent
young brow. “What dog?”</p>

<p>The liveryman stares.</p>

<p>“<em>What</em> dog! Why, the dog you bought off
me ’most two weeks ago! Ain’t forgotten him,
have you?”</p>

<p>Jonesie shakes his head helplessly. “I
fancy,” he responds distantly, “you’ve made a
mistake. I don’t own any dog.”</p>

<p>“Don’t own any—— Say, didn’t you and
that friend of yours buy my fox terrier a while
back and pay me five dollars for him and agree
to pay me four dollars a month for boarding
of him? Didn’t you and he——”</p>

<p>Jonesie shakes his head gently and passes by.</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about any dog,” he
says. “Must have been someone else.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t your name Jones?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but it’s quite a common name.”</p>

<p>“But—but didn’t you buy my dog? You and
that other feller?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not!” replied Jonesie in pained
protest. “We are not allowed to keep dogs at
Randall’s. I wouldn’t think of transgressing
the rules of the school, you know.”</p>

<p>The liveryman studies Jonesie’s guileless
countenance for a moment, and his mouth
slowly falls open. Jonesie looks dreamily up
the street.</p>

<p>“Of course if you <em>have</em> a dog, though, I’d
advise you to keep him away from rats,” he
says kindly. “They might bite him.”</p>

<p>Then, whistling blithely, Jonesie passes on.</p>

<p class="cap">We had beaten Yale hands-down the
year before, and this year, when we
started practice, we had eight out
of eleven of last season’s men, and in spite of
the fact that they had instituted a new system
over in New Haven, had a new coach at the
helm and were reported to have the best material
in years, we couldn’t see how the Elis had
even a show-in. There was nothing to it, any
way you figured it. We weren’t even going to
miss the three we had lost, for we had at least
two good candidates for each of them. There
wasn’t anything could stop us from winning
the Eastern Championship again. That’s the
way it was right up to the first week in October.
Then things began to happen.</p>

<p>I guess we established the hard-luck record
that Fall. Kendall went first. He was left
tackle, and a corker. He fell down in exams.
Then Penniwell, first-string quarter, got hurt
in the Bates game and developed water on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
knee. Next Hanson, fullback, pulled a tendon
in practice. Of course, he would be out only a
couple of weeks, but on top of everything else
it made us feel a bit sick. It reminded one of
the nursery rhyme of the Ten Little Indians.
“One got charley-horse and then there were
nine.” Only it didn’t stop at nine, not by a
long shot. Stearns, our best halfback, fell down
three dinky steps coming out of a recitation hall
and broke an arm. Joe Leverett said he hoped
it would be a warning to him and teach him to
keep away from recitations. You’d think we’d
about reached the limit then, wouldn’t you?
We thought so, anyway. We tackled Amherst
with just four of last year’s team in the line-up
and barely escaped a licking. The Amherst
game was the third on the schedule, and after
that we had the big teams to meet. Of course
by that time some of the earlier invalids were
getting back into shape, and we figured that if
we could stall through the next two games we’d
be in pretty good shape for Princeton and Yale.
But Fate wasn’t through with us. On the Tuesday
following the Amherst scare they hurried
Tom Shawl off to the Infirmary at eleven in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
morning and operated on him for appendicitis
at four <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Good-night!</p>

<p>Of course you remember Shawl, all-America
halfback two years running, the hardest line
plunger in the country and a wizard at kicking.
One of the New York papers the year
before said that “yesterday, at New Haven,
Tom Shawl, assisted by the Harvard eleven, defeated
Yale 17 to 0.” The paper wasn’t so far
off, either. Anyway, you can imagine what it
meant to us to lose Shawl. There was some
vague talk of his getting around in time to play
against Yale, but no one believed in it. We
just about threw up our hands then. I’ll never
forget the conference we had in Pete Haskell’s
room that evening. I was manager that year.
There were five of us there: the Head Coach,
Porter; Jewell, who had the linemen in charge;
the trainer; Pete and myself. We were a sick
and sober lot, I can tell you. We talked and
talked and snarled at each other for two solid
hours and nothing much came of it. The only
thing we decided was that Hackett, right end,
would have to go into the backfield. He had
played half before they’d made an end of him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and he was a good one. But that meant we’d
have to find a corking good man for right end,
and there wasn’t one in sight. There were
plenty of candidates, but not one showed the
real stuff. We talked them all over. Finally
Jewell said:</p>

<p>“Where’s that chap Perrin, who played left
end on the Freshman team last Fall? Isn’t he
back this year?”</p>

<p>Porter sat up. “He’s our man!” he cried.
“He will have to come out!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” asked Jewell.</p>

<p>“Folks won’t let him play,” said Pete. “He
got hurt in the Yale Freshman game last year.
It wasn’t anything serious, but his folks got
scared, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” said Jewell. “Get him out. We
need him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see him to-morrow,” said Porter.
“Glad you thought of him, Walt.”</p>

<p>We talked some more, and about ten o’clock
life looked a bit brighter. With Perrin at right
end and Hackett at left half, we might get by.
Of course, losing Shawl’s goal-kicking meant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
that we’d have to reorganize the whole campaign
against Yale, and that there was just
about three months of hard work to do in six
weeks, but we were all a bit more hopeful when
we said good-night. I stayed behind after the
others went. Billy Sawyer, who roomed with
Pete and played fullback on the Second, came
in just then and we three chewed it all over
again. Billy shook his head over Perrin,
though.</p>

<p>“You won’t get him,” he said. “I know him
pretty well. We were at Milton together. He’s
that sort.”</p>

<p>“What sort?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Well, the sort who keeps a promise.”</p>

<p>“You mean he promised his folks not to
play?”</p>

<p>“Yep. He broke a bone in his hand last year
in the game with the Yale freshies and his
parents got cold feet. He told me about
it. Said he’d promised to keep out of it.
Sort of broke up, too, he was. Too bad, for
you know the sort of a game he put up last
Fall.”</p>

<p>We nodded gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Still,” said I, “he might get his folks to
let him off.”</p>

<p>Billy screwed his mouth up and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Don’t think so. He’s that sort, you see.”</p>

<p>“Bother your ‘sorts’! When Porter tells
him we need him like everything and reads the
riot act to him I’ll bet he will squirm out of it
somehow. You’ll see. Besides, a fellow’s parents
haven’t any right to keep a chap off the team
when—when the college simply has to have
him!”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!” said Billy. “Parents aren’t
bothering about who wins the Yale game, Gus.
Besides, they have got some rights, say what
you want. My dad’s paying a good stiff price
to get me an education and if he told me I must
quit playing football I’d do it. So would you.
So would any fellow.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, Billy, but any sensible parent
wouldn’t do it!”</p>

<p>“Why not? What’s the sense of spending a
pile of money on a chap if he’s going to break
his neck or come out of college with two or
three important bones missing just where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
they’ll show the most? No, Bob, Perrin’s folks
have got the right idea. Merely as an investment——”</p>

<p>“Money isn’t everything,” I said. “There’s
such a thing as loyalty and duty to your college,
Billy.”</p>

<p>“You’re talking about Bob; I’m talking about
his folks. They don’t owe any duty to your old
college, do they?”</p>

<p>“Just the same——”</p>

<p>“Oh, forget it,” said Pete. “Get out of here,
Gus. I’m going to bed. It’s up to Porter, anyway.
I hope he gets him, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said Billy, “but he won’t.”</p>

<p>And he didn’t. Perrin was awfully sorry
about it, but he had made a promise to his
parents and he meant to keep it. Porter told
him he’d have to get his parents to let him off.
Perrin said he wouldn’t ask it; said it wouldn’t
be fair. Porter raved at him and pleaded, but
Perrin just kept on saying how badly he felt
about it and how much he would like to play,
but——</p>

<p>Porter was sore that afternoon. “He’s a
mule,” he said. “A stubborn mule.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“So we don’t get him?” asked the trainer.</p>

<p>Porter closed his eyes in a way he had and
set his mouth. “We get him, all right,” he
answered grimly. “We’ve simply got to
have him. Someone’s got to go and read
the riot act to those folks of his. They live
in Mearsville. Who knows him? Do you,
Pete?”</p>

<p>Pete shook his head. “Only to speak to.
Billy Sawyer does, though. He went to prep
with him.”</p>

<p>“Sawyer of the Second?” asked the coach.
“He’ll do. You take Sawyer and Gus to-morrow
and go out to Mearsville and see them,
Pete. I’d go myself, but with all this mix-up
on my hands I can’t miss practice. I’ll see
Wynant and get him to let Sawyer off. You
have a car, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. How far is Mearsville, and where is
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about a hundred miles; out beyond
Worcester somewhere. Look it up on the map.
It’s a small place, and you’ll have no trouble
finding them, I guess. Come around to-night,
the three of you, and we’ll dope out a line of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
talk. Don’t let Perrin hear about it, though.
He might try to queer us. He’s a mule.”</p>

<p>We left the Square the next day right after
lunch in Pete’s car. It had only one seat, and
Billy Sawyer sat on the floor with his feet on
the running-board and his knees hunched up
under his chin. We made good time, for Pete’s
boat is some goer, and we got to Mearsville
about four o’clock. On the way we went over
our argument. Porter had told us what we
were to say and Billy was to do most of the
talking. He was a peach at talking, Billy was.
He’d been on three debating teams and knew all
the tricks. Funny about him, too. You’d think
with his gift for that sort of stuff that he’d
have turned into a lawyer or a statesman or
something, but he didn’t. Billy’s adding up
figures in his father’s factory to-day. Just
shows that you never can tell, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>It was a pretty country around Mearsville,
and we made the trip on one of those peachy
Indian summer days that sometimes happen
along in October. We had a pretty good time,
too. We almost ran through Mearsville without
knowing it, because there wasn’t much in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
sight except a post-office and a store. We asked
at the post-office where Mr. Perrin lived, and
the postmaster came out and showed us how
to go.</p>

<p>“Wonder,” said Billy, as we went on, “what
sort his father is. If we knew that it might
help us.”</p>

<p>“What’s his business?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t know. Don’t know a thing except
that Bob’s an only child. He seems to have
plenty of money, so I suppose his old man’s
fairly well fixed. If he’s one of the crabbed
kind we might as well turn around right now
and go back.”</p>

<p>“Buck up,” said Pete. “When you turn
that line of talk on him, Billy, he’ll just wilt
before our eyes.”</p>

<p>“Huh,” said Billy. “Wish you had it to
do. Don’t see what I let them rope me into
this for, anyway. It’s not my funeral.”</p>

<p>“It’s what you get for knowing the chap,”
said I. “Bet you that’s the place now, the stone
gate ahead of us.”</p>

<p>It had solid comfort written all over it. There
was an old-style white house that rambled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
around behind a lot of trees and some lawn and
nearly fooled you into thinking it was a genuine
antique. When you got near it, though,
you saw it was a reproduction. It looked like
a compromise between a gentleman’s estate and
a nice little place out of town. Everything
was neat and well groomed, and we felt like
vandals for mussing up the newly dusted gravel
drive with the automobile tracks. Pete was
whistling “This is the Life” softly as we drew
up to the door. A trim-looking maid showed
us into a living-room with about a million long
French windows and a thousand dollars’ worth
of white and yellow chrysanthemums standing
around in tall vases. Billy cleared his throat
and Pete sneaked away to the further side of
the room, pretending he wanted to see the view
from a window. I started to follow, but Billy
grabbed me.</p>

<p>Mr. Perrin came in the next instant. I don’t
know what sort of a man the others had pictured,
but I know he didn’t look at all like what
I’d expected. If I’d seen him, say, in a club
without knowing who he was, and anyone had
asked me to guess, I wouldn’t have thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
twice. “Noted explorer just back from successful
rummage in Peru,” I’d have answered.
As Billy would say, he was that sort. He had
a rather long, lean face with a lot of lines, a
wide mouth, a thin nose and a pair of faded
blue eyes that were deep set and looked lighter
than they were because his skin was as brown
as a saddle. He was tall and straight and lean
and looked about as fit as any man I ever saw.
I warmed up to him right away. Couldn’t help
it. There was something about that mouth and
those pale blue eyes that was awfully friendly.
And when he shook hands he did it quick and
hard, and you could feel that his muscles were
like little steel wires. It was up to me to introduce
myself and the others, which I did, and
as soon as I said “football” I saw by a little
gleam in his eyes that he was dead on to our
game. But he told us in a nice deep voice that
he was glad to see us, got us seated in big comfortable
chairs, offered cigars and made us feel
right at home. Then he waited, smiling, for us
to shoot. So Billy stuck his hands in his pockets
and opened up.</p>

<p>Billy did himself proud. I wish I could remember<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
just what he said, but, then, it was
more the way he put it over than anything else.
Porter had tipped us to be dead sober. “Make
him understand that the situation is big and
serious. Don’t smile except to be polite, and
then do it as if it hurt your face.” So Billy
started out as grave as a minister. He began
by outlining the condition the team was in because
of injuries and such, dwelt on the hopeless
position in which the coaches found themselves
and predicted ruin and disaster unless
new material could be found to prop the tottering
structure, or words to that effect. And all
the time he spoke in low, fateful tones like a
doctor breaking the news to the family after
a consultation. If he had kept it up two minutes
longer I’d have been in tears.</p>

<p>“I gathered from the papers,” said Mr. Perrin
just as gravely, “that things were in pretty
bad shape at Cambridge. I’m very sorry, Mr.
Sawyer.”</p>

<p>Then he waited again, looking appropriately
funereal. But there was a little flicker in those
blue eyes of his that told me he wasn’t as concerned
as he pretended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>Billy took a fresh start and began on Bob
Perrin. He allowed you to understand by the
tone of his voice that there was a ray of hope,
after all, but that you weren’t by any means
to think the patient out of danger. He told
about the fine work done by Bob last year on
the Freshman team and how if he would spring
into the breach all might yet be well. Billy
said so many nice things about Bob that I
couldn’t see how his father could help looking
a bit proud. He didn’t, though. He just kept
his eyes on Billy and waited. It seemed as if
his watchful waiting game was getting on Billy’s
nerves, for Billy stumbled once or twice
and his voice began to flatten out a little. He
took the ground that in such a stupendous crisis
as then confronted the college—the college we
all loved—Billy’s voice sort of took on a
tremolo effect there—all selfish thoughts and
desires should be brushed aside. At such a
time it was the duty of all loyal sons of Harvard
to—to put their shoulders to the wheel,
to banish prejudices, to forget self and—er—strive
as one man to avert the disaster that
threatened to engulf their glorious Alma Mater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>Said Mr. Perrin: “Did Bob send you out
here?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Perrin, your son does not know of
our visit. Mr. Porter, our Head Coach, tried
to persuade him to play, but he replied that he
was bound by a promise to you and that it
would not be fair for him to ask to be released
from it. It was then that Mr. Porter decided
to see you himself, feeling certain, as he said,
that when you once realized the gravity of the
situation you would eagerly and gladly give
your consent to Bob’s playing.”</p>

<p>“Ah.” Mr. Perrin glanced at Pete and then
at me. “But neither of these gentlemen is Mr.
Porter, I believe?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Mr. Haskell is Captain of the
Varsity and Mr. Kirke is Manager. Mr. Porter
was unable to come since his presence at
practice is indispensable just now. We represent
him, sir, and I have tried to bring you his
message just as he delivered it to me. Were
he here he could undoubtedly speak more convincingly,
sir, but——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Mr. Perrin. “You do yourself
an injustice. He could not, I am certain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
have dispatched a more capable and eloquent
emissary.” He paused and looked toward the
windows. “Gentlemen, I am going to suggest
that we go outdoors. This is much too fine a
day to be inside. You will, I hope, stay to dinner
with us.”</p>

<p>We all said we wouldn’t think of it, but he
didn’t pay much attention to that.</p>

<p>“Let me have my way, please,” he went on.
“Both Mrs. Perrin and I shall be most pleased
to have you. We don’t have many opportunities
to entertain, and you really must humor us.
Besides, I want you to meet her, and just now
she is unable to appear. Now let us take a walk.
I want to show you my place. You know we
folks who live in the country always drag our
visitors around the grounds the first thing.”</p>

<p>We went out on the porch. Mr. Perrin
dropped behind to get his cap and stick, and
the three of us looked at each other questioningly.
Billy was frowning and Pete looked
blank. I remember I shook my head. Mr. Perrin
joined us then, and we set out around the
house. He showed us his stable and barn and
greenhouses and piggery and a cellar where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
raised mushrooms, and a lot of things like that.
Pete got full of enthusiasm right away and
asked a lot of questions. Pete subscribes to
<cite>Country Life</cite> and draws plans of model farms
at lectures. Somehow, out of doors we all
forgot to be gloomy, and the first thing we
knew we were laughing at the colts in the paddock
and chatting away just as if there wasn’t
any Stupendous Crisis. After we’d seen everything
Mr. Perrin led the way across a meadow
to a little hill that had pine trees clumped on
top of it and brown needles underneath. It was
when we were climbing the hill that Mr. Perrin
said:</p>

<p>“You must forgive me for being a bit
slow. This leg of mine isn’t as spry on the
grades.”</p>

<p>I noticed then for the first time that he
limped a little and bore pretty heavily on his
stick. I slowed down with him and asked: “Accident,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I broke it in football.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I. I couldn’t think of anything
else to say just then.</p>

<p>“It was in a game with Pennsylvania a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
many years ago now,” he went on. “We used
to play on Jarvis Field in those days.”</p>

<p>“Where the tennis courts are now?” I asked.
“Were you—were you on the Varsity, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was captain that year. This break
kept me out of the Yale game, and I remember
that I felt pretty badly about it.”</p>

<p>“It was pretty tough luck,” I muttered. I
did a whole lot of thinking the rest of the way
up the hill.</p>

<p>When we got to the top we sat down on the
pine needles in the sunlight, and Mr. Perrin
filled a pipe. “Perhaps,” he said as he started
to light it, “I shouldn’t do this, as you chaps
are in training.” Billy and Pete told him it
didn’t matter any to them. It didn’t to me because
I didn’t smoke. I’d promised my folks
not to until I was twenty-one. There was a fine
view from where we sat, and the country was
as pretty as a picture, with the sun getting low
and sending long shafts of golden light across
the fields. It was quiet, too, so quiet you could
hear a cowbell tinkling half a mile away. Billy
put his hands under his head and stretched
himself out on his back with a sigh. Pete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
hugged his knees and looked blissful. I suppose
he was thinking of the place he meant to
have when he was through college. There
was a rock near me with moss growing all
over it, and I settled my back against it and
blinked at the sun. After a minute Mr. Perrin
said:</p>

<p>“It always seems easier to me to think and
talk out of doors. I suppose it’s because I’ve
spent a good deal of my life there.” And then,
speaking quietly and sort of lazily, he told us
some things he’d seen and that had happened
to him. He wasn’t an explorer, after all. He
was an engineer and he had spent most of his
life in the West and Southwest building irrigating
dams and canals and things. I’ll bet
they were good ones. He was that sort, as
Billy would say. Some of the yarns he told
were corkers, and he told them in such a smiling,
matter-of-fact way that they sounded bully
and made you want to pack up and hike out
there where such things happened. He had had
adventures, all right! And he had us laughing
one minute and sitting still and gripping our
hands the next and hardly daring to breathe!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
Gee, if I could tell a story the way he could, I’d
never do another thing!</p>

<p>“It’s a big country out there,” he said
finally, “with lots of things to be done.”</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Pete, “you’d find it
rather tame back here, Mr. Perrin.”</p>

<p>“Tame? Not at all. I like this best. But
then, I’m getting along toward where the quiet
life begins to look pretty good, boys. I find
now when I go back out there that saddles are
harder than they used to be and ponchos aren’t
as soft to sleep on as hair mattresses. But I’m
always glad to get there again—and always
glad to come back. In two or three years more
I won’t have to make the trip very often, I
guess. Bob will do that for me. He’s going
to have a man’s job on his hands when he’s
ready for it.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to take up engineering too, sir?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“No, that won’t be necessary. That part of
it is done. Of course it’s best for him to know
something of it, and so he and I go out there
in the summers and I show him the why and
the how. I dare say he learns as well that way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
as he would if he took a course at the Scientific
School. Bob’s work will be to manage what
I’ve built. It will be his after a while, you see.
Bob’s the only one we have and there won’t be
any others now. It’s a good deal like putting
all your eggs in one basket, you see. When
you do that you’re liable to be mighty careful
of the basket.”</p>

<p>He filled his pipe again, looking off across
the field toward where the smoke was going up
straight from the chimneys of the house. We
didn’t say anything. After a minute:</p>

<p>“It’s a fine, comforting thing to know that
there’s someone coming after you to carry
things along,” he said thoughtfully. “It makes
what’s ahead of you look pretty trifling. I always
feel a deep pity for men who haven’t sons.
It seems to me that they’ve failed in what God
sent ’em here to do. I guess your fathers know
what I mean, and you will know it, too, some
day—I hope. I hate to think what it must be
like for men who haven’t any children when the
shadows begin to deepen. Maybe all fathers
don’t feel the way I do about it, but I guess they
must. Four of the finest words I know of are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
these: ‘From father to son.’ Well, well, I’m
boring you with all this stuff. And it’s getting
a little chilly now. We’ll walk back and get
ready for dinner. We dine early out here. I
hope you won’t mind.”</p>

<p>When we got back he took us upstairs to a
fine big room, and it took just a glance to show
that it was Bob’s. There were all sorts of photographs
stuck around: school nines and elevens
and track teams, you know, with Bob’s face
peering out from some of them. There was a
bookcase in one corner with all Bob’s old school
books and story books on the shelves. And
there were some pewter cups on the mantel and
some pennants on the walls and a split baseball
bat and a canoe paddle with things written
on it and a plaited hair bridle and a pair of
wicked-looking Mexican spurs. It was just a
regular boy’s room with all the things a fellow
accumulates and hates to throw away even as
he grows older. Mr. Perrin took up some of the
photographs and pointed out Bob in them; Bob,
a little kid in knickerbockers; Bob in track
togs, with his fingers tight over his grips; Bob
holding a football in the center of a group; Bob<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
wearing chaps and a big sombrero and seated
on a cow pony. Then he went out and left us,
and we washed up. No one said very much,
and we all hurried.</p>

<p>Downstairs we met Mrs. Perrin. I guess
you’d call her homely, but she was the sort of
homely that looks good to a fellow. She was
small and looked not very strong, but she was
all right. You knew she could do one thing to
the King’s taste, and that was to be a mother.
We had a bully dinner. Nothing fluffy, but regular
food that went right to the spot and stuck.
We were all of us hungry, too, all of us except,
maybe, Mrs. Perrin. I don’t think she ate
much, but she surely saw to it that we did.
Billy made a great hit with her because he had
been at Milton with Bob. She didn’t talk a
whole lot about Bob, but you could see that she
was pretty proud of him just the same. There
wasn’t a word said about why we were there.
We were just friends or college mates of Bob’s,
and that was enough. Mrs. Perrin was full of
fun in a quiet way, and it was dandy to see how
she and Mr. Perrin played up to each other.
She prompted him to tell this story or that, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
he came back at her the same way. About
the middle of dinner we felt as if we’d known
those folks for years! We sure had a dandy
time.</p>

<p>We didn’t stay at the table after Mrs. Perrin
went because we weren’t smoking, and Mr.
Perrin pretended he didn’t want to. So we
went back to the library, and the first thing I
knew Pete was over at the piano with Mrs. Perrin
pulling the music about for him. Pete’s a
wonder at the ivories, and he played and we
all sang; Mr. Perrin, too, when he knew the
song; and had a regular merry-merry for about
an hour. Then we had to mosey back to Cambridge,
and Mr. Perrin sent out and had Pete’s
car brought around from the stable. They
made us take sweaters and coats, for we hadn’t
brought any, and it was getting chilly. We
were to leave them with Bob. We said good-night
to Mrs. Perrin in the library, and she
made us all promise to come again, which
wasn’t hard to do, for we were dead eager to.
Mr. Perrin went out to the car with us and
stood around while we lighted up and packed
ourselves in. Pete started the engine the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
time and tried not to look surprised, and we
all shook hands and Mr. Perrin said we mustn’t
forget our promise to come again, and we said
he wasn’t to worry about that! But then he
didn’t move away, and we saw he had something
to say and Pete throttled down his engine.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I’d like to know,” he said
earnestly, “and it’s this. I want Harvard to
win this year, boys, perhaps every bit as much
as you do. I’m afraid I haven’t appeared very
sympathetic this evening, but I do sympathize
with you in your trouble. I’ve been through
with something of the same sort myself, and I
haven’t forgotten. And I’m not going to tell
you that whether we win or lose the world’s going
to keep on whirling. I know it didn’t seem
so to me in the old days, and it doesn’t seem so
to you. I don’t believe there’s an old player
who follows the fortunes of the Team any more
closely than I do, boys. I’ve ridden eighty
miles at night to learn the result of a Yale
game. I’m telling you this because I don’t want
you to think that I’ve outgrown my devotion to
the college, my loyalty to the Team.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>He paused and Pete pretended to tinker with
the switch.</p>

<p>“And now one thing more,” said Mr. Perrin.
“Two things, rather; for I want to tell you that
I appreciate the fine way in which you have refrained
from showing impatience or criticism
of my attitude in regard to Bob. It may be
that you secretly look on me as a selfish, pig-headed
old codger——”</p>

<p>Billy started to say something, but Mr. Perrin
continued:</p>

<p>“And perhaps I am. But partly because you
have acted like three of God’s gentlemen and
partly because—well, because an old player can
never quite forget, I’m going to leave it in your
hands. If you think the Team needs Bob more
than I do, you tell him that he is to go in there
and play his level best! Good-night, boys!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mearsville was ten miles behind before anyone
said anything. Then it was Billy, and, since
we had a hard road and the engine purred no
louder than a kitten, we heard him even though
he only muttered. “Fellows <em>do</em> get hurt,” he
growled. “You can’t deny that. Look at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
list of them just in our own time: Choate and
Riley and ‘Fan’ Tanner and a whole bunch,
to say nothing of this year’s list.”</p>

<p>A mile further on, I said: “I suppose a fellow
with a busted leg wouldn’t be much use out
there on that job.”</p>

<p>Going into Worcester, Pete said: “There’s
that chap Nelson.”</p>

<p>“Did well at Exeter,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“With six weeks to work on him,” I murmured,
“seems to me——”</p>

<p>Later Pete broke out with: “Hang him, he
had no business saying that we thought him
selfish and pig-headed!”</p>

<p>“Still, we did, you know,” I reminded, “before.”</p>

<p>“Before, yes, but not after! Anyway, I
didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Mean to say I did?” demanded Billy somewhat
hotly.</p>

<p>“Shut up! What we’ve got to decide is
this,” I said. “What are we going to tell Porter
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Tell him?” grunted Pete, taking a corner
on two wheels. “Tell him nothing doing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>I showed this to Pete, who went in heavy for
English Composition and can talk you deaf,
dumb and blind about characterization, climax,
crisis, suspense and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i>, and he says I
finished my story at the last paragraph and
that if I write any more I’ll be pulling an anti-climax.
Maybe he’s right, but I know that if I
was reading this yarn I’d want to know who
won the Yale game. And so I’m going to tell
you. And if you think the way Pete does, why,
you can stop up there where it says “nothing
doing.” That’s all right, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Well, Bob Perrin didn’t come out for the
team. Porter fumed and kicked for a while,
and then yanked Nelson off the bench and
sicked half a dozen assistant coaches on him.
He had a pretty tough time of it for about five
weeks. No matter which way he turned there
was always one or more coaches waiting to
grab him. I’m not sure they didn’t read him
to sleep out of the rules book and camp outside
his door at night. But they did what they set
out to do, believe me! They made an All-America
end of him, even if they almost killed him
in the operation. And, although we lost to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
Brown, and although Princeton swamped us, we
came right back on the twenty-fourth of November
and put it over the Elis, 7 to 3.</p>

<p>As Billy would say, we were that sort!</p>

<p class="cap">Joe Tyson, playing third on the Randall’s
School first team, pegged the ball across
in the general direction of first base.
Steve Cook stabbed the air with a gloved hand
and the ball continued blithely on its way, disappearing
behind the grandstand. Four blue-stockinged
youths raced home, the fourth registering
the tenth tally for Popham Academy.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., seated cross-legged
in front of the bench on the home side
of the field, score book on knees, credited the
enemy with four runs and added a black dot
under the “E” column and opposite the name
of Tyson.</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured Jonesie reflectively,
“in order to throw to first you’ve got to know
more than the ball.”</p>

<p>Of the three occupants of the bench, weary
and disgruntled with waiting, none replied to
the sagacious observation. Jonesie, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
hadn’t expected any reply. He didn’t care.
When there was no one to talk to, Jonesie
talked to himself. That was much better than
keeping still. Jonesie had a horror of being
bored, and nothing bored him quicker than inactivity,
either of body or tongue. That was
the reason why, on a perfectly glorious afternoon
in early June, he was to be found seated
Turk-fashion here keeping score for the Team.</p>

<p>Art Simpson, the manager, whose duty it was
to preside over the official score book, was in
the infirmary with a delightful case of double
mumps, and Billy Carpenter, baseball captain,
had, so to speak, drafted Jonesie from a comfortable
seat in the stand, thrust a black-covered
book and a leaky fountain pen upon him
and bade him keep the score. Jonesie knew
how to do that after a fashion, but his fashion
was not Art Simpson’s, and he soon found the
intricacies too many for him. After Jimmy
Buell had been caught flat-footed off second and
chased down between that station and third by
exactly six-ninths of the opposing team, Jonesie
gave it up in despair. The only redeeming feature
of his task was the fact that it allowed him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
to square accounts to some extent with one or
two fellows he had grudges against. Thus Carpenter
himself, for imposing such a task on
Jonesie, had been credited with two errors
when, as a matter of fact, Billy had so far
played his position faultlessly. Jimmy Buell,
too, had erred, according to the book, not once,
but three times, and even Steve Cook, who was
a particular friend of Jonesie’s, had a neat
period set opposite his name in the error column.
Jonesie had chuckled when he set that
down. It was always fun getting a rise out of
Steve!</p>

<p>Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., was a cherub-faced
youth of fifteen with coppery brown hair
brushed sleekly back, gray-blue eyes that were
pools of truth and innocence, a somewhat button-like
nose that attested to good nature, and
a general appearance of physical and mental
well-being. Folks generally, and nice elderly
ladies in particular, fell in love with Jonesie at
first sight. They simply couldn’t help it. Such
candor and truthfulness and innocence shone
from his countenance it did one good merely to
look upon it. For the rest, he was comfortably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
rounded as to figure, a fact which perhaps
increased his likeness to a cherub, dressed very
carefully—Jonesie was always a little in advance
of the fashions—and carried himself with
an air.</p>

<p>After much searching the ball was back in
the pitcher’s hands. (For no especial reason
Jonesie credited Gordon, who had thrown it in,
with an assist!) Carey Bingham, football captain,
who was umpiring, was evidently getting
tired of standing out there in the sun, for he
called three strikes on the Popham batsman in
succession—Proudfoot, the Randall’s slab artist,
had never been known to pitch three good
ones in succession before!—and then ruled the
next man out at first in spite of the fact that
Steve Cook had quite failed to tag him. But
Popham had a comfortable lead of eight runs,
it was getting late and Carey wanted to get on
the river before suppertime. Popham objected
only half-heartedly to the decision, being
doubtless quite willing to hurry the battle
through.</p>

<p>The bench filled as the perspiring players
trotted in from the field. Billy Carpenter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
squeezing in behind Jonesie, glanced at the
score.</p>

<p>“Ten to two, isn’t it?” he asked wearily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jonesie. “Gordon up!
Proudfoot on deck! Billings in the hold!”</p>

<p>“What’s the inning, Jonesie?” inquired Joe
Tyson from further along the bench.</p>

<p>“Last of the ninth,” answered Jonesie
promptly.</p>

<p>“Get out! It’s the eighth!” declared Billy
Carpenter. “Let’s see. Of course it’s the
eighth, you idiot!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” murmured the non-official scorer.
“All right. I just said ninth so as you fellows
would get off easier.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” said Billy unamiably. “Never
you mind about us. Just you—— Here, what
the dickens are those things over there in my
column?”</p>

<p>“Those?” asked Jonesie innocently. “Oh,
those are errors.”</p>

<p>“Errors! When did I make an error, you
lunkhead?”</p>

<p>“I forget; third, I guess; maybe it was the
fourth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>“You’re dippy! I haven’t made an error to-day!
You rub those out, Jonesie, or I’ll kick
you back to school!”</p>

<p>“My mistake,” replied Jonesie untroubledly,
canceling the dots. “Say, Billy, why don’t you
have a good team?”</p>

<p>“The team’s all right,” answered the captain,
mollified as the untruthful periods disappeared.
“We’ve had perfectly rotten luck to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” Jonesie’s tone was maddeningly
sarcastic. “Blame it on the luck, Billy.
Say, honest, Billy——”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be so fresh with your ‘Billys,’
kid,” advised the other, prodding Jonesie’s
spine with the toe of his shoe. Billy was a
senior, and at Randall’s seniors exacted proper
respect from lower-class fellows.</p>

<p>“My mistake, Mr. Carpenter,” corrected
Jonesie sweetly. “I was going to say—Proudfoot
up! Billings on deck!—going to say that I
could make up a team of lower-class fellows
that would beat you all around the block, Bil—er—Carpenter.”</p>

<p>“You could do wonders,” responded the captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
derisively. “Suppose, though, you credit
that Popham first base with a put-out if you’re
not too busy talking nonsense.”</p>

<p>“No trouble at all,” murmured Jonesie,
placing a period in the wrong space and so
adding to the glory of the Popham left-fielder.
“The trouble with this bunch of yours is that
they can’t bat, can’t field and can’t handle the
ball. Aside from that, though, Billy, they’re
certainly a fine lot. Who threw that to first?”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you watch the game and find
out?” snarled Billy.</p>

<p>“Call this a game? It—it’s a farce, that’s
what it is, a blooming farce!” Jonesie gave
the assist to the shortstop on a chance and chattered
on. “You see, Bil—that is, Mr. Carpenter—in
order to play baseball you’ve got to
know more than the ball.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out,” growled Billy. “A fat lot
you know about it!”</p>

<p>“If you mean baseball, I know a great deal.
I don’t pretend that I invented the game, Billy,
but I certainly organized the Nile Valley
League and——”</p>

<p>“Say, you bum scorer, who’s up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>“You are, you talented right-fielder!”</p>

<p>“What on earth is the Nile Valley League?”
inquired Billy, who had never heard of that
mythical aggregation. Jonesie glanced around
with a look of pitying surprise.</p>

<p>“And you’re captain of a ball team!” he exclaimed.
He shook his head gently. “Honest,
Billy, I look at you in wonder! You’re on deck,
by the way.”</p>

<p>Billy got up and selected a bat with much
care. Jonesie watched him pessimistically.</p>

<p>“Say, Cap, in order to use that you’ve got
to know more than the bat,” he volunteered
helpfully. Billy scowled.</p>

<p>Randall’s failed to add to her score and Popham
came in. With a man on first the second
batsman lined a hot one at Billy, and Billy
watched it travel into center field while he
wrung a bunch of aching fingers. Jonesie
smiled and restored one of the canceled errors
opposite the captain’s name.</p>

<p>“Prophetic,” he murmured. “That’s what
it was, prophetic!”</p>

<p>Popham added another run to her tally in
that first of the ninth, but Jonesie didn’t trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
to score it. He was too busy drawing a picture
of Steve Cook at first on the margin of the
page. It wasn’t a good likeness, but it showed
a lot of action, and it pleased Jonesie. So enthralled
was he with his artistic endeavors that
the teams had changed sides before he realized
it, and he hurriedly set down several assists,
put-outs and errors wherever they looked best.</p>

<p>Billy was disgruntled when he got back
to the bench, and he was rather rude in the
way in which he thrust Jonesie aside to get his
seat.</p>

<p>“Ah,” observed Jonesie, looking about with
a gratified air, “the heroes are back again! In
order to catch a ball, Billy, you’ve got to know——”
But a muscular hand closed about
Jonesie’s throat from behind and the remark
was not concluded. Instead, “Buell at bat!”
he announced huskily. “Gordon on deck!
Proudfoot in the hold!”</p>

<p>Jonesie remained silent while Jimmy Buell
fell victim to the puzzling slants of the Popham
pitcher. But he felt communicative to-day, and
after Buell had disconsolately reseated himself
Jonesie went on brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span></p>

<p>“Honest, Carpenter,” he said, “I wasn’t
joshing about that.”</p>

<p>“About what?” growled Billy, working the
fingers of his right hand experimentally to see
if they were broken or merely dislocated.</p>

<p>“About making up a team from the lower-class
fellows and showing your bunch a few of
the rudiments of baseball. You see, Billy, it
isn’t so much that your fellows <em>can’t</em> play; I
think they could if they knew how; but no one
has ever shown them, do you see? Now, I think—what?
yes, you’re on deck, Billings!—I think
that if you could only play a game or two with
a team that knew a little about it, do you
see——?”</p>

<p>“I’ll wring your neck for you in a minute,”
returned Billy angrily. Jonesie silently considered
the chances of Billy’s carrying out the
threat. It was Billy himself who made the next
remark.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see the bunch of players you’d
get together, Jonesie,” he said. “They’d be
wonders.” He laughed most disagreeably.
“Bring ’em along some day and give us some
sport, Jonesie. We need practice——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>“You sure do! You need more than that,
though, old top; you need to learn what to do
on a ball field. For instance, now, if someone
explained to Proudfoot that a bat is made to
swat the ball with and not to hang over his
right shoulder, he might do something besides
posing like one of those Roman gladiators at
the circus. Yes, sir, Billy, you fellows certainly
ought to have a little instruction.”</p>

<p>Captain Carpenter opened his mouth to reply
hastily and angrily. But he closed it again.
After all, it was only Jonesie talking! Jonesie
indicated on the score book that Proudfoot had
been hit by a pitched ball and had taken his
base and then credited the Popham pitcher with
a put-out on the ground that anyone who inflicted
pain on Proudfoot was a public benefactor
and deserving of reward! Then, after another
moment, Jonesie spoke again.</p>

<p>“What day will it be convenient to play us,
Billy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Play who?” inquired Billy, wondering
whether it was worth while to relieve Steve
Cook in the coacher’s box and try to get Proudfoot
around for a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“This team I’m going to get up,” answered
Jonesie. “Any day next week will suit us.”</p>

<p>Billy laughed derisively. “Cut out the comedy,
Jonesie,” he begged.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t much blame you,” was the reply.
“It would look bad to be beaten by a lot
of lower-class fellows. I guess you’re right to
back down, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up, Jonesie! And credit Billings
with a two-bagger, why don’t you? Say, what
sort of a score is that you’re keeping, anyway?”</p>

<p>“This? This is the finest little score you
ever saw. What did you say Billings made?”</p>

<p>“I said—— <em>Good work, Charlie!</em> Guess I’d
better go out and take a hand.” The bases were
filled and Billy’s good nature was restored by
the prospect of adding a few runs to their
meager score.</p>

<p>“Then you mean you won’t play us?” insisted
Jonesie as the older boy pushed by him.</p>

<p>“Play you? Yes, we’ll play you, Jonesie.”
Billy laughed. “Bring on your team!”</p>

<p>“Next—next Thursday?” yelled Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p>Jonesie whistled softly to himself, not at all
melodiously, and scrawled strange forms on
the margins of the score sheet. He was thinking.
When Jonesie thought it was safe to assume
that sooner or later, and probably at no
very distant time, something of interest would
happen at Randall’s!</p>

<p>His preoccupation was rudely dispelled by
the sound of a bat striking a ball and the frenzied
shouts of the few onlookers who had survived
eight wearisome innings. Jonesie looked
up to see Steve Cook legging it to first, the Popham
center-fielder racing back toward the distant
fence and the bases emptying. Behind first
base Billy Carpenter was waving and shouting.
Behind third Jimmy Buell was doing likewise.
Jonesie sighed. More work for the scorer!</p>

<p>And then a flat silence fell. Away out in center
field a blue-stockinged youth had, after a desperate
race, put up a hand and pulled down the
ball. Steve had flied out! The game was over!
Popham had won, 11 to 2! or was it 10 to 2?</p>

<p>Jonesie added an error to Billy’s column on
general principles and closed the book with a
vindictive slam.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“Sparrow,” asked Jonesie that evening,
“did you ever play ball?”</p>

<p>It was Saturday and so, of course,
Sparrow Bowles, who was a tall and lanky
youth and, in spite of being Jonesie’s roommate,
was much disliked by that young gentleman,
had a perfect right to spend his time over
one of Dumas’ most exciting romances. It
might be added, however, that Sparrow would
have done just what he was doing had it been
Monday or Friday or any other day of the
week. I refuse to even insinuate a virtue that
Sparrow didn’t possess. Sparrow looked up
regretfully from the book.</p>

<p>“No,” he muttered. “What for?”</p>

<p>“Then you’re the chap I want,” replied
Jonesie cheerfully. “I’ll put you down——”
He frowned intently for a moment at the list
before him and poised a pencil above it—“I’ll
put you down for third base.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“You can put me down for—for batter, if
you like,” jeered Sparrow, thus showing
the depths of his ignorance of the National
Game, “but you don’t get me to break my
fingers!”</p>

<p>Jonesie didn’t even glance up. “That just
about finishes it,” he murmured. “I think,
though, I’ll put Pinky at first instead of Wigman.
Pinky says if he doesn’t play there he
won’t play at all.”</p>

<p>“Say, what are you talking about?” demanded
Sparrow, curiosity getting the better of
an inherent contempt for any of Jonesie’s
plans.</p>

<p>“I’m talking,” answered Jonesie with dignity,
folding his list and returning it to a
pocket, “about the All-Stars Baseball Team.
You see, I’m getting up a team to give Billy
Carpenter’s bunch of amateurs a little practice.
We play them Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Play the School Team!” Sparrow turned
Dumas’ face down on his knees and stared
blankly at his roommate. “Say, are you funny
in your head? Why—why, they’d lick the stuffing
out of any team you could make up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what Billy thinks,” chuckled
Jonesie.</p>

<p>“Should think he might!”</p>

<p>“But this team I’m getting up, Sparrow, is
something a little bit out of the ordinary. Listen
to this.” Jonesie found his list again and
read it for Sparrow’s benefit. “Bumstead,
pitcher; Jones, catcher; Trainor, first base;
Hoyt, second base; Bowles, third base; Wigman,
shortstop; Clint Wrenn, right field;
George Wrenn, center field; Nash, left field.
What do you think of that, Sparrow?”</p>

<p>“I think you’re crazy,” replied Sparrow
with enthusiasm. “I’ll bet there isn’t a fellow
in the lot ever played baseball!”</p>

<p>“Yes, there is,” rejoined Jonesie with a grin.
“Both those Wrenns have played a lot. I
thought first I wouldn’t have them, but I
couldn’t get anyone else. You see, I told Billy
I’d make up the team from the lower classes.
But I put the Wrenns in the outfield where they
won’t be able to do much harm.”</p>

<p>“If they can play why don’t you let them?”
asked Sparrow puzzledly.</p>

<p>“‘A little learning is a dangerous thing,’”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
quoted Jonesie. “I’ve tried to get fellows
who never have played, because I can teach
them. You can’t teach a fellow who thinks he
knows the whole thing to start with. Do you
see?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see,” said Sparrow bluntly. “I
suppose it’s another of your silly jokes, but you
don’t get me into it!”</p>

<p>“Joke!” exclaimed Jonesie indignantly.
“There’s no joke about this. It’s a perfectly—er—sincere
attempt to help the School Team.
Didn’t you hear what happened to them to-day?
Got licked by Popham! Ten to two—or eleven
to two; there’s some doubt about the exact figures,
I think! And what’s Popham? A little
old one-horse school up back there in the woods!
Don’t you see that the Team needs to go up
against a bunch that can give them a few pointers
on how the game ought to be played? Why,
Billy was almost tearful when I agreed to get
a nine up, and——”</p>

<p>“Aw, piffle!” interrupted Sparrow inelegantly.
Sparrow was somewhat addicted to
inelegant speech. I trust he did not learn it
from Dumas. “Why, there isn’t a fellow on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
that list who knows what a ball looks like!
Maybe the Wrenns do, but the rest——”</p>

<p>“You forget that we have three days to practice,”
answered Jonesie patiently. “I shall
teach them——”</p>

<p>Sparrow laughed immoderately. “You!
Bet you never played baseball in your life!”</p>

<p>“Right-o; at least, not much. But I’ve
watched a lot of it and I’ve got a pretty good
notion of the way it ought to be played, old
Sparrow Hawk.” Jonesie found his cap, settled
it on the extreme back of his head and
moved toward the door. “First practice is at
three on Monday, Sparrow.”</p>

<p>“Me! You won’t get me into it,” declared
Sparrow warmly. “I won’t have anything to
do with your old team!”</p>

<p>Jonesie observed him in a pained way. “I’m
afraid I’ll have to insist, Sparrow,” he said
gently but firmly. “You wouldn’t like it generally
known how Faculty found out about that
little party at Steve Cook’s. You know, Sparrow,
I’ve never told anyone about that—yet.
But if you don’t play on the All-Stars I’ll be so
dreadfully disappointed that I may get sort of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
loose-tongued. Disappointment affects me that
way. Queer, isn’t it? Three o’clock, Sparrow.
Ta-ta!”</p>

<p>Jonesie closed the door behind him, and Sparrow
could hear him tramping down the corridor,
whistling blithely; Sparrow frowned
darkly at the book on his knees.</p>

<p>“And I never caught a ball in my life!” he
groaned.</p>

<p class="noic">SCHOOL TEAM VS. ALL-STARS!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THERE WILL BE A GAME OF BASEBALL BETWEEN THE SCHOOL
TEAM AND JONES’S ALL-STARS ON THE PLAYING FIELD AT
THREE O’CLOCK THURSDAY. THIS IS THE ATHLETIC EVENT OF
THE SEASON, AND IT IS HOPED THAT THE SCHOOL WILL SHOW
ITS APPRECIATION OF THE EFFORTS OF THE ALL-STARS TO PROVIDE
INSTRUCTION FOR THE SCHOOL TEAM BY TURNING OUT IN
FORCE. SPECIAL TRAINS WILL BE RUN, AND A RATE OF ONE
AND A HALF THE REGULAR FARE WILL BE CHARGED.</span></p>

<p class="noic">COME ONE, COME ALL!</p>
</div>

<p>This notice appeared on the bulletin board on
Monday morning and provided a deal of amusement
and much speculation at Randall’s.
Jonesie was overwhelmed with requests for further
particulars and offers of skilled assistance.
In every case Jonesie referred the inquirer to
the notice and informed him that the team was
already made up. Billy Carpenter cornered
him in the corridor between recitations and demanded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
to know what he meant by such tomfoolery.
Jonesie was surprised and pained.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you agree to play my team on Thursday?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“I was only in fun, you little idiot! A fine
lot of ball players you’ll get! You take that notice
down, Jonesie. If you don’t, I will!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me it’s a funny thing to back down
now,” replied Jonesie, more in sorrow than in
anger, “after I’ve made the team up and we’re
to begin practice this afternoon. Still, of
course, if you are really afraid to play us——”</p>

<p>“Who’s on your team?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>Jonesie enumerated the members of the All-Stars
and Billy grinned.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to pitch?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Tubby Bumstead.”</p>

<p>Billy’s grin broadened and he clapped
Jonesie on the shoulder. “All right,” he said
gaily, “we’ll play you four innings, Jonesie,
if you last that long. It’ll be funny, anyhow,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Funny!” said Jonesie indignantly, even a
little bitterly. “You think it’s funny when I go
to all this trouble to help you fellows out! I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
a good mind not to do it! I’ve a good mind to
just let you fellows go on the way you’re going
and get licked by every little whippersnapper
team that comes along, Billy! Funny! Huh!
You won’t think it’s so funny when we lick
you!”</p>

<p>“All right, Jonesie,” Billy laughed. “We’ll
play you. Who do you want for an umpire?”</p>

<p>Jonesie shrugged his shoulders. “Any fellow
you like. How about Gus Peasley?”</p>

<p>“Has he ever umpired a game?” asked Billy
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out. If you don’t want Gus,
though——”</p>

<p>“Sure, Gus will do. Let’s make it as funny
as we can, eh?”</p>

<p>And Billy went off chuckling, leaving Jonesie
apparently silent with indignation.</p>

<p>At noon he sought out Gus Peasley. Gus was
an Upper Middler and so, in a way, might be
considered impartial. “Ever umpire a ball
game, Gus?” asked Jonesie.</p>

<p>Gus shook his head. “I was kicked by a mule
once, though,” he said with apparent irrelevancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“You’re the fellow we want, then,” said
Jonesie with deep conviction, “to umpire the
game on Thursday.”</p>

<p>“Say, are you really going to play the School
Team?” asked the other eagerly. “Why didn’t
you give me a show, Jonesie?”</p>

<p>“I agreed to play only lower-classers, Gus.
But Billy and I both want you to umpire.”</p>

<p>“Shucks, I never umpired a game in my life!
I’d look fine, wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“I’ll lend you a book of rules, Gus, and you
can study it a bit. The game’s on Thursday
at three. Don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“But—— Here! Hold on, you silly idiot!
I’m not going to umpire for you! Don’t be a
chump, Jonesie!”</p>

<p>“Why not, when we both want you to? It
isn’t anything to do and it’ll be heaps of fun,
Gus.”</p>

<p>“Heaps of fun!” muttered Gus. “Someone’ll
bump me on the head with a bat, I suppose!
Well, all right. If you can stand it I
can. Don’t forget those rules, though. Does
that book tell when a foul ball is a strike and
all that sort of thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“Surest thing you know! You’ll have it all
down pat by Thursday, Gus. Thanks awfully.”</p>

<p>On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons
the All-Stars were supposed to hold practice,
and about three-fourths of the school went
down to the field to enjoy the spectacle. But
the All-Stars were not to be found on any of
the afternoons mentioned. That Jonesie and
Pinky Trainor and Tubby Bumstead and all
the other members of the team were busy somewhere
seemed probable since none of them was
visible around the school, but they certainly
were not on the playing field, and some six
score youths were correspondingly disappointed.</p>

<p>But had any of them penetrated to the Games
Room situated on the upper floor of the Recitation
Hall they would have been at once surprised
and interested. There, behind locked
doors, the All-Stars were practicing. The practice
was novel, however. Instead of batting and
fielding and sliding to bases, the All-Stars sat
in chairs or along the edge of the billiard table
and not a bat nor a ball was to be seen. But
Jonesie was coaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>“Now, then, take Jimmy Buell. He will play
left field for them, I suppose. Who knows anything
about Jimmy?”</p>

<p>No one did, apparently, until young George
Wrenn hazarded: “He’s sort of crazy about
golf, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Tubby Bumstead.
“He’s trying for the team, or he was in the
Fall.”</p>

<p>“That may do,” said Jonesie thoughtfully,
making a note on the sheet of paper beside him.
“We may be able to work that up. Anything
else?”</p>

<p>Evidently that exhausted Buell and after a
moment Jonesie went on.</p>

<p>“The next fellow is Gordon,” he announced.</p>

<p>Several of the All-Stars chuckled, and
Jonesie smiled demurely himself.</p>

<p>“Onions!” said Pinky explosively, and the
room rang with laughter.</p>

<p>“Onions,” agreed Jonesie. “That’ll do for
Gordon, I guess! And that leaves only Proudfoot,
and——”</p>

<p>“‘Quentin Durward,’” proclaimed Ernest
Hoyt, “‘is probably the most popular work of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
the great novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray.’”</p>

<p>The All-Stars chuckled and giggled.</p>

<p>“‘A lambkin,’” contributed Sparrow Bowles,
“‘is a fleece-bearing quadruped closely related
to the domestic lamb or sheep.’”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe he ever wrote that one,”
laughed Tubby.</p>

<p>“Yes, he did, too. Sumner Hayes heard Old
Fury read it in class last year.”</p>

<p>“It’s great, anyway,” applauded Jonesie,
scribbling feverishly on his paper. “Lambkin
for Proudfoot’s! There, that’s the lot of ’em.
I’ll have copies of this ready for you fellows
to-morrow and then, next day, we’ll have a quiz.
Practice is over!”</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">“Bumstead at bat, Trainor on deck!”
proclaimed Arthur Simpson, who, released
from the infirmary, was once
more on hand. Not, however, that Simpson was
according this contest with the All-Stars the
honor of a score.</p>

<p>“Now then, Tubby,” called Captain Jonesie
from the visitors’ bench, “remember the lesson!”</p>

<p>Tubby, a little embarrassed because of the
fact that he had never played ball before so
large an audience, grinned as he stepped into
the box. The audience cheered madly. Tubby
dared a glance at the crowded stand and Proudfoot
sent over a perfectly good strike. Gus
Peasley, however, more ill at ease than anyone
else there, proclaimed it a ball. Rufe Brown,
the School Team’s catcher, howled dismally.</p>

<p>“Say, Peasley, do you know a strike when
you see it?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>“A strike,” replied Gus, half closing his eyes
as an aid to memory, “is a ball passing over
any part of the plate and between the batter’s
shoulder and knees.”</p>

<p>“Well, didn’t that?” asked Rufe menacingly.</p>

<p>“I dare say, but the batsman wasn’t ready
for it,” replied Gus quite calmly. He might be
frightened, but he didn’t intend anyone should
know it! “Play ball!”</p>

<p>Grumblingly the catcher threw the sphere
back to pitcher and said uncomplimentary
things about Gus as he knelt to give his signal.
Proudfoot’s next attempt was so palpably
poor that Gus merely grunted. Then came
a second strike, which Gus called by its right
name, thereby slightly mollifying the disgusted
Rufe. But Proudfoot was unable to add a third
and eventually Tubby Bumstead, after some
urging on the part of his teammates and the
audience, trotted to first, and Jonesie promptly
stationed himself near by to coach. The stand
howled and laughed and whistled, Pinky
Trainor picked up a borrowed bat and faced
the pitcher, and Jonesie began to coach the runner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>“Now then, Tubby, don’t forget the lesson!
Take a lead; that’s it! Oh, let him throw if he
wants to. Take another yard. Whoa! Why,
Steve, you really caught it! Fellows, did you
see Steve Cook catch the ball? Do it again,
Steve, will you please? They didn’t see it. All
right, Tubby! On your toes again! Ready to
steal on the second ball, you know! Don’t forget
the lesson!”</p>

<p>Pinky, following instructions, declined to
offer at any of the balls offered him, and was
finally called out. Clint Wrenn, however, actually
had the effrontery to wallop one of Proudfoot’s
best out-shoots and send it safely between
second and third, while Tubby romped
to the next station.</p>

<p>“Well done, Clint!” applauded Jonesie as
he strode to the plate. “Oh, very nicely managed,
sir. Ah, Mr. Proudfoot, salutations to
you! And how is your throwing arm to-day?”</p>

<p>Proudfoot smiled and whipped a quick one
over to first. Unfortunately Steve Cook was
so busy listening to Jonesie that the ball went
past him and Tubby legged it home, while Clint
went on to second, sliding to the bag, not because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
there was any actual danger of being
thrown out, but because he wanted to do the
thing thoroughly. The spectators applauded
generously this gratuitous performance, and
then gleefully welcomed Tubby across the plate.
Billy Carpenter, looking both puzzled and disgusted,
viewed Jonesie with suspicion.</p>

<p>“Strike him out, Proud,” he directed. “He
can’t hit!”</p>

<p>“Ay, so do!” chanted Jonesie, circling his bat
wildly about his head and dancing a sort of
Highland fling at the plate. “Be neither pitiful
nor kind, Mr. Proudfoot! Dispose of me
quickly, I pray! Who am I to stand here and
dare your Jove-like bolts? Ah, Mr. Proudfoot——”</p>

<p>“Ball!” quoth Gus.</p>

<p>“Get off the plate, Jonesie,” directed Rufe
Brown. “Want to get one in the ribs?”</p>

<p>“Not I, forsooth! See, I retreat. Mr. Umpire,
I request you to observe that most
promptly I retreat! With all my heart——”</p>

<p>“Str—— Ball two,” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> Say, you cross-eyed chump, what
do you think you’re doing here? Are you umpiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
or—or——” Rufe choked with emotion.
Proudfoot rolled his eyes to heaven and crossed
his arms to express his contempt for the decision.
Whereupon Clint Wrenn started
abruptly for third base and——</p>

<p>“Look out!” bawled the pitcher.</p>

<p>“Third! Third!” shouted Billy Carpenter
frantically.</p>

<p>“Out of my way!” yelled Rufe, stepping forward
with the ball.</p>

<p>“Where are you coming?” inquired Jonesie
anxiously, stepping in front of him.</p>

<p>“Throw it!” implored the third baseman.
Rufe pushed Jonesie ungently aside and threw
it. But the ball struck in front of the base and,
although Joe Tyson made a heroic effort to stop
it, went rolling on into left field, while Clint
romped home into the outstretched arms of
Jonesie. Up hurried Pitcher Proudfoot and
Captain Carpenter and First Baseman Cook,
each sputtering with wrath.</p>

<p>“Say, you—you——?” began Proudfoot, indicating
Gus Peasley with a clenched fist.</p>

<p>“Put him back on third,” demanded Billy
irately. “Jonesie got in Rufe’s way deliberately!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
If you can’t umpire decently——”</p>

<p>“This isn’t baseball, anyway,” declared
Steve bitterly, still smarting from the incident
of the throw that went by first. “It’s a
farce!”</p>

<p>“Did you see what he did to me?” asked
Jonesie in hurt tones. “He pushed me aside—violently!
He said to me, ‘Look out!’ and I
said, ‘Where are you coming?’ and then he distinctly
pushed me! The umpire saw it, didn’t
you, Gus? And you’re perfectly <em>disgusted</em>,
aren’t you? Considering, Billy, that we are
your—er—guests here to-day, I don’t think
we should be pushed and shoved about! I
really don’t! Anyway, not with violence,
Billy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out! If you fellows want to play
ball, why, play ball, but don’t try any baby
tricks. This isn’t a—a circus!” And Billy
eyed Jonesie and Umpire Peasley with distinct
displeasure.</p>

<p>“Of course we want to play ball!” responded
Jonesie indignantly. “That’s what we’re here
for, isn’t it? That’s what we practiced for all
these days! Go on and play; we’re ready. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
didn’t stop the game, did we? Honest, Billy,
you surprise me, you do really!”</p>

<p>“Do they get that last run?” demanded
Proudfoot truculently.</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Gus. “The runner scored,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Jones got in Rufe’s way, though, and the
ball went into the outfield——”</p>

<p>“In order to throw to third, Mr. Proudfoot,”
declared Jonesie authoritatively,
“you’ve got to know more than the ball.”</p>

<p>“Oh, give them the run,” said Steve. “We’ll
lick ’em to a standstill. Come on, fellows.”</p>

<p>They went, lingeringly, filled to the brim with
remarks they wanted to offer, but didn’t. After
all, as Steve Cook said, it was only a farce, a
parody. Only—and Billy Carpenter picked up
a pebble and hurled it away with unnecessary
violence—Jonesie did make a fellow so mad!</p>

<p>Jonesie struck out miserably, and Hoyt, rolling
a slow one to Proudfoot, followed him to the
bench. Then the School Team came in and the
All-Stars distributed themselves about the field,
many in really original locations. For instance,
Nash, playing in left, took up a position some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
twenty yards behind third base and Wigman
seemed unable to tear himself away from close
proximity to the second bag. Tubby Bumstead,
who had once pitched two games for a
grammar school team, strode to the box with
all the nonchalance of a Mathewson, picked up
the ball and promptly threw it over Jonesie’s
head.</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, Tubby!” cried Jonesie,
trotting after the sphere. “That’s pitching,
old top! You got it with you to-day! Now,
then, first man, Tubby! Don’t forget the lesson!
Bingham likes ’em high. Give him one,
Tubby.”</p>

<p>Tubby’s attempt was not successful, and Gus
droned, “One ball!”</p>

<p>“That’s the way, Tubby! Now another one
a little bit higher. Bingham doesn’t like to
reach for ’em, do you, Bing?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be so fresh!” growled Bingham,
who was a senior and properly mindful of the
respect due him from lower-class fellows.</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, Bing! Here it comes
now! Bang it, Bing! Bing it, Bang! Bang——”</p>

<p>Bingham swung at a wide one and missed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
and Jonesie, who had never before tried to
catch behind a swinging bat, turned his back
and dexterously stopped the ball. The audience
approved wildly. Bingham scowled.
Tubby, recovering some of his lost science, sent
a nice straight ball across, and Bingham, trying
to shut his ears to Jonesie’s artless prattle and
not succeeding, struck too late. Jonesie stepped
nimbly aside and ducked, and the ball collided
with Gus Peasley. Gus said “Ugh!” in disgusted
tones and doubled up. However, as he
was properly guarded by a body protector, no
harm was done, and Jonesie sent back the ball
and followed it with a flood of conversation.</p>

<p>“That was a dandy, Tubby! Sort of a fade-away,
what? Say, you’ve got it with you to-day,
all right! That’s pitching ’em, Tubby!
He couldn’t even see it. His sight isn’t what
it was since he blew up the laboratory!”</p>

<p>“Say!” Bingham turned threateningly upon
Jonesie. “You cut that out or I’ll beat you,
you fresh kid!”</p>

<p>“No offense, Bing——”</p>

<p>“And don’t call me ‘Bing’!”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, old top! I only mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
that laboratory experiment of yours because——”</p>

<p>“You say that again and——”</p>

<p>“How was it?” demanded Jonesie as the ball
settled into his mitt.</p>

<p>“Strike three!” replied Gus promptly.</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> You—you robber!” shrieked Bingham.
“I’ve a good mind to—to——” He
started toward Gus, but Jonesie interposed.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose your temper,” he pleaded. “It
<em>was</em> a strike, Bing, honest it was! Right over
the middle——”</p>

<p>“You, too,” interrupted Bingham angrily.
“You tried to queer me! I wasn’t looking at
the ball——”</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” demanded Carpenter,
pushing his way in to the agitated group. Bingham
explained a trifle incoherently. Billy listened
and took him by the arm.</p>

<p>“All right. Come on,” he said wearily.
“You got caught, Bing. No use kicking. Hit
it out, Rieger.”</p>

<p>And Rieger did hit it out. He sent a fine long
fly into left field. Young Nash, hands in pockets,
turned and watched it descend to earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
some two hundred feet beyond him while the
spectators laughed and howled with glee. It
was George Wrenn who fielded the ball to second
in time to hold Rieger at that bag. Jonesie,
mask in hand, stepped authoritatively in front
of the plate.</p>

<p>“Nash,” he called, “play back another foot
or two!”</p>

<p>Joe Tyson went to first to coach and Buell
lolled over behind third. On second Rieger
seemed strangely inattentive to his duties as a
base runner. Hoyt and Wigman stood close by,
and from all indications the trio were engaged
in conversation. In fact, it was possible to
catch snatches of it even in the stand:</p>

<p>“I’m not saying you did, am I? Every fellow
knows, though——”</p>

<p>“... Again and I’ll....”</p>

<p>“Don’t rile him, Wigman! Let bygones be
bygones——”</p>

<p>“Come on!” bawled Tyson exasperatedly.
“Get off that base!”</p>

<p>“Hey! Rieger! What’s the matter with
you? Are you glued there? Come on!” And
Jimmy Buell, back of third, waved frantically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>“... Just once more,” threatened Rieger
wildly, “and I’ll come over there and——”</p>

<p>“... Sore subject,” piped Hoyt. “As far
as I’m concerned ... as long as he owns up
to a thing....”</p>

<p>Steve Cook let one delivery go by and then
landed on the next. By some miracle Pinky
Trainor, at first, managed to get in front of the
ball and, although it bounded away from him,
he picked it up and raced across the bag the
fraction of a second ahead of Steve. The stand
applauded warmly and hilariously and Rieger
went on to third. Joe Tyson, grinning, tapped
the plate with a bat and winked at Tubby.</p>

<p>“A low one for Joseph,” called Jonesie.
“He eats ’em alive, Tubby. Now then, one
right down here! That suit you, Joe?”</p>

<p>Joe shook his head. The umpire called
“Ball!” doubtfully, and Jonesie rewarded him
with a grieved look.</p>

<p>“He didn’t like that one, Tubby. Try again.
Here, Joe, show him where you want it.” And
Joe obligingly indicated the locality with his
bat. “Get that, Tubby?” asked Jonesie anxiously.
“Now try and give him one like that.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
We strive to please, Joe. That’s our motto.
Right over, Tubby, and just where the gentleman
wants it! Here she comes, Joe! Whack
it! Whack it! Whack——”</p>

<p>“Strike!” proclaimed Gus.</p>

<p>Joe grinned at Jonesie. “Say, that was all
right,” he said.</p>

<p>“Glad you liked it. If you don’t get what
you want, ask for it, Joseph. Send him another
of those, Tubby. He likes ’em. Here we
go! Here we go! Don’t hit him, Tubby! One
more now!”</p>

<p>“Two balls!” said the umpire.</p>

<p>“That’s pitching, Tubby, that’s pitching!
But don’t make him reach for ’em. He’s a
friend of mine. What’s the matter with your
neck, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have it looked at. All right,
Tubby! I knew a fellow who had one of those
things on his neck and—— Make it good,
Tubby! Sort of low, you know!—and didn’t
look after it, Joe——”</p>

<p>“Strike two!” announced Gus.</p>

<p>“Say!” bawled Joe, turning wrathfully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
“Keep your mouth closed for a minute, will
you? You’re worse than a phonograph!
There’s nothing the matter with my neck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” Jonesie tossed the ball back.
“Better hit at this one, Joe. Tubby always
makes the fourth one good. I don’t want to
alarm you about your neck, but if I had it I’d
certainly have it attended to before it got any
worse. If you let it go very long they’ll have to
operate and——”</p>

<p>Against his better judgment Joe put a hand
tentatively to the back of his neck. Tubby
wound up quickly and pitched. Joe’s hand
came down suddenly and grabbed at his bat,
and the bat swung wildly.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” cried Gus.</p>

<p>Joe leaned on his bat and looked disgustedly
at Jonesie.</p>

<p>“You wait until this game’s over,” he said
dispassionately. “I’ll see you later, Jonesie!”</p>

<p>Jonesie smiled sweetly and sorrowfully.</p>

<p>The School Team took the field and the All-Stars
came to bat in the first of the second inning.
But although George Wrenn found
Proudfoot for a hit that landed him on first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
and although Jonesie coached him superbly and
incessantly, the next three batters went out ignobly.</p>

<p>Billy Carpenter started things going for the
School Team with a long hit into center and
reached second. Jimmy Buell swaggered to the
plate, tapped it knowingly and waited.</p>

<p>“What does he want?” asked Tubby.</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure! What sort of a ball would
you like, James?” Jonesie inquired solicitously.
Jimmy laughed.</p>

<p>“Any old thing, Jonesie, as long as I can
reach it.”</p>

<p>“The gentleman is not particular, Tubby.
Try a few of those ‘floaters’ right over the tee.
James is using a niblick this shot.”</p>

<p>Jimmy stirred and muttered.</p>

<p>“One ball,” said Gus.</p>

<p>“Try again, Tubby! Careful of this one,
James, and keep your eye on the ball. Don’t
forget the carry-through, old top. Going to
try a full swing?”</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it out!” growled Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Let’s see, James, you didn’t make the team
last Fall, did you? It’s simply awful the way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
favoritism rules in athletics here! Keep your
eye on the ball, James! Careful now!”</p>

<p>“Strike one!”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d better try a brassie, old man.
You want distance this time, you know. If you
get bunkered——”</p>

<p>“Keep it up! You’re not bothering me a bit,
Jonesie.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you’ll make the Golf Team yet,
James. Any fellow with an eye like yours and
a—er—physical development——”</p>

<p>Jimmy let the next one pass, and Gus
promptly announced another strike. Jimmy
wanted to argue about it, but Jonesie returned
the ball without delay, and Jimmy had to content
himself with a few well-chosen remarks
which, owing to the fact that he umpired from
a place well removed from danger, Gus probably
never heard.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” continued Jonesie, “it’s awfully
hard to hit a golf ball, James. They’re
so small, aren’t they? Regular little pills! Did
you ever hit one, James?”</p>

<p>“I’ll hit you if you don’t close your mouth!”</p>

<p>“Fie, James! You’re losing your temper!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
If you do that you’ll never make the Golf Team,
I know. Now then, James! Hit behind the
ball; you topped that last one, you know; and
follow through, James, follow——”</p>

<p>Jimmy followed through all right, but the
ball whacked against Jonesie’s protector—<a href="#i_fp328">Jonesie
didn’t pretend to catch them</a> when
struck at—and Gus crooned, “Striker’s out!”
Tubby, running up, got the ball in time to hold
Billy Carpenter at second. Jimmy Buell retired
to the bench with dragging bat, talking
all the way. Gordon, the next batsman, played
his position in right field better than he batted.
But on this occasion he found what he wanted
in the first ball pitched, and swung hard. Unfortunately
the ball started straight down the
third-base line, and although Billy Carpenter
bounded frantically to the left to get out of its
way, it bounded off him and rolled toward second.
Billy walked disgustedly to the bench,
rubbing his leg, and Gordon proudly perched
himself on first.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp328">
  <img src="images/i_fp328.jpg"  alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption"><a href="#Page_329">“Jonesie didn’t pretend to catch them.”</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Two gone!” called Jonesie cheerfully.
“Play for the batter, fellows! And don’t forget
the lesson!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span></p>

<p>“Say, what’s this old lesson you’re always
talking about?” asked Proudfoot as he squared
himself to the plate.</p>

<p>“Never you mind, Horace Erasmus,” replied
Jonesie. Proudfoot, who was not at all proud
of his name as set down in the school catalogue,
frowned.</p>

<p>“And never you mind about my name,” he
rejoined shortly.</p>

<p>“Well, it <em>is</em> your name, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your business. You’re too
fresh. You——” Proudfoot’s further remarks
were halted by the strange behavior of
the All-Stars. One by one they were edging
toward the left of the field. As they went they
held their noses and looked accusingly toward
first base, where Pinky Trainor was elaborately
binding a handkerchief about his face.
Even Tubby showed signs of uneasiness.
Jonesie’s voice rang out sharply.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” he
asked irately. “What are you all doing?”</p>

<p>“We can’t stand it, Cap,” called Hoyt from
out in short left field.</p>

<p>“Stand it! Stand what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p>“The—the odor!”</p>

<p>“What odor?”</p>

<p>“Onions!”</p>

<p>There was a brief moment of silence, and
then the fellows in the stand behaved most remarkably.
They rocked to and fro in their
seats, clung to each other desperately and even
rolled into the aisles, all the while emitting
choking, gurgling sounds that might later
evolve into laughter, but which at present more
closely resembled the painful gasps of a person
lately rescued from drowning! And the same
or similar effects might be noted on the field
and on the School Team’s bench. In fact,
everyone appeared to be on the verge of apoplexy
save only Mr. Gordon. Gordon, with
clenched fists and crimson cheeks, faced the
world desperately. Then, while the stand still
choked and sputtered, his eyes fell on Pinky
Trainor beside him, Pinky swaying dizzily as
one about to pass into unconsciousness, Pinky
with his nose tightly bound with a none too
clean handkerchief. With a roar of rage Gordon
sprang and Pinky went down. But Billy
Carpenter, red of face and making odd gurgling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
noises in his throat, leaped weakly to the rescue
and the writhing forms were torn apart. And
then—and only a few witnessed it—Tubby, who
had apparently run to the aid of his fallen teammate,
suddenly dug a hand holding a baseball
into Gordon’s ribs and Gus Peasley, with a
feeble wave of his hand, gasped:</p>

<p>“Out—at—first! <em>Oh, help!</em>”</p>

<p>The latter part of the remark seemed addressed
to no one in particular, and Gus sat
down on the turf and held his sides very tightly,
rocking to and fro, which, you must acknowledge,
was a most undignified proceeding for an
umpire.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">V</h3>
</div>


<p class="cap">The All-Stars met in Jonesie’s room
that evening and disbanded. But first
Jonesie addressed them from the
study table most eloquently.</p>

<p>“As long,” declared Jonesie magnificently,
“as the annals of Randall’s School survive the
fame and glory of the All-Stars will—er—illuminate
the pages of history! We have to-day
performed a deathless, imperishable deed.
Summoned from—er—the humble walks of life,
like the Minute Men of old or What’s-his-name
from the plow, we sprang into the breach and—er—battled
nobly and valiantly. Victory was
ours! For two hard-fought innings we held
the School Team at bay and finally triumphed
by valor and science!”</p>

<p>Young Nash snickered. Jonesie shot a reproving
glance at him and went on.</p>

<p>“Handicapped by ignorance, by lack of practice,
by youthfulness and want of experience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
we stood shoulder to shoulder upon the trampled
field and——”</p>

<p>“Joe Tyson says we didn’t win,” interrupted
Tubby. “Says the game didn’t go four and a
half innings.”</p>

<p>“Who cares what he says? Who cares what
any of them say? They refused to continue.
They forfeited the game. The umpire said so.
We won a noble victory with the aid of courage,
science and——”</p>

<p>“Onions,” murmured Pinky.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
